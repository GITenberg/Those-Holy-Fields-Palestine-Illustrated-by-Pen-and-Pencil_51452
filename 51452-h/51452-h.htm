The journey of which a brief account is
given in the following pages was undertaken
in the early part of 1873. The
object of the writer was to compare the
<em>Land</em> and the <em>Book</em>, and by an examination
of the topography of Palestine
to illustrate the histories of Scripture.
Had any doubt existed in his own mind
as to the veracity of those histories,
it must have been dispelled by the
minute agreement which he traced between
the indications of the narrative
and the physical geography of the
country. No “fable,” however “cunningly
devised,” no myth or legend coming into existence at a later
age, could have adapted itself so precisely to the topographical details
of the scene. The main design of the present volume has been to
trace these coincidences, and thus to elucidate and confirm the biblical
narrative. Whilst he has availed himself of all the help he could gain
from the writings of former travellers, he has in no case depended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>upon them, but endeavoured, by a personal and careful inspection
of the sites, to arrive at an independent and accurate conclusion.</p>

<img src='images/i_005_3.jpg' alt='(Drawing of men next to a tent)' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the Illustrations, which form so large a part of the present
volume, fidelity rather than artistic effect has been aimed at. Many
of the engravings are from drawings made on the spot, but a greater
number are from photographs. Those of Messrs. Bergheim and
Nicodemus of Jerusalem, and Madame Bonfils of Beyrout, have
been largely used for this purpose; and the writer desires to express
his gratitude for the liberality with which the Committee of the
Palestine Exploration Fund have placed their admirable series at
his disposal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Maps are enlarged by permission of Messrs. W. and A.
Keith Johnston, from their Royal Atlas Map of Syria, which for
correctness and fulness of detail is worthy of the high reputation
they have long enjoyed as chartographers.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_9 c009'>A REEF of sharp jagged rocks, over which
the surf breaks fiercely, runs parallel
with the shore, forming a natural
breakwater. Inside the reef the water
is smooth enough, but too shallow to
admit anything except fishing-boats
and small coasting-craft. The harbour
has silted up by the sand-drift
from Arabian and African deserts, so
that steamers and sea-going vessels
must anchor outside. Jaffa, a town of
four thousand inhabitants, picturesque
at a distance, as all Eastern towns
are, stands on the slope of a hill and
comes close down to the beach. It
is encircled by a broad belt of gardens
and orange groves. A rich fertile
plain stretches for ten or twelve miles
inland. Then a range of hills bounds
the view.</p>

<p class='c000'>This ancient port was famous both
in legend and history. It is the site
of the fabled rescue of Andromeda
by Perseus, and the city is declared
by Pliny to have been standing before the Flood. The cedar-wood
for building the Temple was sent hither by Hiram, king of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Tyre.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Here Jonah, “flying from the presence of the Lord,” found a ship
about to sail to Tarshish, “so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into
it.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Somewhere within the circuit of those grey walls, “widows stood
weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made
whilst she was yet with them.” And amongst the tan-pits on the shore
once stood, perhaps still stands, the house of Simon the Tanner, where Peter
was taught by vision that Jewish exclusiveness was to end, and that henceforth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>he should “call nothing common or unclean.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is our first view of

<p>JAFFA FROM THE NORTH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A number of boats, manned by half-naked Arabs, howling, yelling, and fighting
like demons, cluster round the steamer. In one of them, retained for the use
of our party, the fight is so fierce that our dragoman leaps down into it, and
lays about him right and left with his heavy <i>korbash</i>. This proving of no
avail, he seizes one of the Arabs by the throat, and throws him into the sea,
to sink or swim as it may happen. Order being at length restored, we take
our seats in the boat, are skilfully steered through a gap in the reef, and soon
find ourselves at the foot of some black slimy steps, leading to the Turkish
custom-house. A crowd of wretched creatures press round us, clamouring for
<i>backshish</i>. The unpaved road is ankle deep in mud. Foul sights, and yet
fouler smells, offend the senses. To most of my companions the sight was
altogether new and strange. For myself, having had some previous experience
of the filth and squalor of an Oriental town, I was not taken by surprise.
But the disenchantment of the rest of the party, as they first set foot on the
soil of Palestine, was complete. One American gentleman, who had come
prepared to go into ecstasies, and had avowed his intention of falling on his
knees on landing, to express his gratitude for being permitted to tread the
sacred soil, looked round with a comical expression of bewilderment, and
exclaimed, “Is this the Holy Land?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Picking our way through a tortuous labyrinth of dismal alleys, we found
our tents pitched outside the town. The camping ground is a spot of rare
beauty. The Mediterranean, of a clear crystalline blue, studded with white
sails, rolls up upon the beach. The long coast-line of Philistia runs north and
south. Groves of orange, lemon, citron, fig, and pomegranate, vineyards
and gardens, the produce of which is famous throughout Syria, form a broad
belt round the city. The plain of Sharon, bright with verdure and enamelled
with flowers, stretches inland. The mountains of Ephraim, blue against the
eastern sky, form a beautiful frame for a lovely picture. It was easy to understand
how a name meaning “the beautiful” should have been borne by the
town for three thousand years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The traditional house of Simon the Tanner furnishes, from its flat roof,
a fine point of view for this charming scene. And there is reason to
believe that the tradition is not far wrong. The house is “by the sea-side;”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
the waves beat against the wall of its courtyard. An ancient well,
fed by a perennial spring, furnishes the water needful for the tanner’s trade;
and tanneries of immemorial antiquity probably go back to the time of
Peter’s visit or even earlier. The vision here vouchsafed to the Apostle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>gains a new appropriateness on this spot. Joppa has always been the port
of Jerusalem. It is, indeed, the only port of Southern Palestine. Thence
“the ships of Tarshish” were seen coming and going. The “isles of Chittim”
(Cyprus) lie just below the horizon. It was the point at which the Jewish
and Gentile world came into contact. Peter looking out over the waters of
“the Great Sea” towards Greece and Rome, where the gospel was to win its
greatest victories, would be at no loss to apply the lesson taught by the
vision.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of Tabitha is fondly remembered by the people of Joppa.
Tabitha or Dorcas (<i>i.e.</i> the gazelle) is partly a personal name—partly a term
of endearment. An annual festival is still celebrated on the 25th of May,
when the young people go out into the orange-groves around the town
and spend the day in a sort of pic-nic, singing hymns and ballads in her
honour.</p>

<p class='c000'>In modern times Jaffa has acquired a sad notoriety from the infamous
massacre of his prisoners, and the alleged poisoning of his plague-stricken
troops by Napoleon Bonaparte. The spot is yet pointed out where, amongst
the sand-hills on the beach, four thousand Turkish and Albanian troops, who
had surrendered as prisoners of war, were shot down in cold blood.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>JAFFA FROM THE SEA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Passing out from the town we cross the Plain of Sharon, the exquisite
fertility and beauty of which made it to the Hebrew mind a symbol of prosperity.
“The excellency of Carmel and Sharon”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> was proverbial. “The
earth mourneth and languisheth” when “Sharon is like a wilderness.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> When
the Most High shall again “bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah
an inheritor of my mountains,” its first result will be that once more “Sharon
shall be a fold for flocks.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> In the Song of songs, “I am the Rose of
Sharon,”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> is the symbol to express the highest ideal of grace and beauty.
As we rode across the plain, bright with the vivid green of early spring, and
plucked handfuls of the innumerable flowers—cyclamens, anemones, roses, lilies,
tulips and a score of others—which gemmed the turf or grew “unprofitably gay”
amongst the corn, we could enter into the feelings of Hebrew poets and
prophets as they exulted in “the glory of Sharon.” But where were the inhabitants?
This fertile plain which might support an immense population is
almost a solitude. Two or three wretched hamlets, mere clusters of mud
huts, are the sole representatives of the numerous and thriving cities which
once occupied it.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Here and there was a solitary Arab breaking up the clods
with a plough which remains unchanged in form from the earliest ages.
These were the only signs of life we could discover. Day by day we were
to learn afresh the lesson now forced upon us, that the denunciations of
ancient prophecy have been fulfilled to the very letter,—“the land is left void
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and desolate and without inhabitants.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Within the last few years, however,
there has been an improvement in some parts of the plain, arising from the
establishment of a German agricultural colony near Jaffa, of a model farm
supported by a society in London, and the acquisition of a considerable tract
of land by Messrs. Bergheim of Jerusalem. The German colonists retain,
unchanged, the dress and manners of their fatherland, and it is not a little
curious to meet a bevy of fair-haired, blue-eyed, red-cheeked damsels driven by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a Silesian peasant in a genuine <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">einspanner</span></i>, in a district made memorable by
the exploits of Samson against the Philistines.</p>

<p>RAMLEH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Three hours from Jaffa stands <span class='sc'>Ramleh</span>, which has been identified with
the Ramah of the Old Testament and the Arimathea of the New, but without
sufficient authority. Its chief object of interest is a magnificent tower, resembling
the famous Giralda of Seville, quite perfect, which rises from the
ruins of an ancient khan. From the summit a superb view is gained. To
the east are seen the mountains of Israel, bare and monotonous, but not
without a certain impressiveness. Westward the Mediterranean stretches to
the verge of the horizon. All around lies the plain of Sharon. On the slope
of a hill about three miles distant stands a little white-walled village, conspicuous
by a lofty ruined tower. It is the Lod of the Old Testament, <span class='sc'>Lydda</span> of
the New.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Here Peter “found a certain man named Æneas, who had kept
his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him,
Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he
arose immediately.” Here, too, he received the request of the saints at Joppa
to visit them in their trouble at the death of Dorcas. As the road has remained
unchanged from the earliest times, we can trace the whole route by which the
sorrowing disciples came and the apostle returned with them. In hagiology,
Lydda is distinguished as the birth-place of St. George, the patron saint of
England. The Church, the ruins of which are visible from a distance, was
destroyed by Saladin, and restored by Richard Cœur de Lion.</p>

<p>GERMAN COLONY NEAR JAFFA, WITH THE PLAIN OF SHARON AND THE MOUNTAINS OF EPHRAIM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Soon after leaving Ramleh the road begins to ascend and the country
grows wilder. We are approaching the elevated plateau on which Jerusalem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>stands, two thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea. Up
to the time of David the whole maritime plain over which we have been
riding was held by the Philistines. The defiles and passes we are now
about to enter formed the marches—the debatable ground, the possession of
which was contested inch by inch during successive generations. A little to
the north of us stood the city of Ekron, whither the Ark of God was brought
from Ashdod. We
can trace the path by
which the milch-kine,
yoked to the new
cart on which the
Ark was laid, left
their calves behind
them and “went
along the highway,
lowing as they went,
and turned not aside
to the right hand or
to the left; and the
lords of the Philistines
went after them
unto the border of
Beth-shemesh. And
they of Beth-shemesh
were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes,
and saw the Ark, and rejoiced to see it.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> The names of Ekron and Beth-shemesh
are easily identified in Akir and Ain-shems. As we saw the green
slopes of the hills with their fields of wheat and barley, and the labourers
in the busy light of the declining sun, it was easy to realise the whole scene.
Tracing the history step by step and noting how the localities exactly fell
into the requirements of the narrative, it was impossible not to be struck
by the precise accordance of the one with the other. The land and the book
formed a perfect illustration of one another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two traditional sites are now passed—El Latron, the name of which is
said to be derived from its having been the abode of the penitent thief, and
Amwâs, the ancient Nicopolis, long regarded as the <span class='sc'>Emmaus</span> of the New
Testament.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Though the identity of the latter site was for a thousand years
unquestioned, and has recently been reasserted by the high authority of
Dr. Robinson, it seems to me to be quite untenable. Its distance from
Jerusalem is too great. The evangelist fixes it at “three score furlongs;”
Amwâs is a hundred and sixty. Robinson assumes an error in the <span class='fss'>MSS.</span>,
for which there is no authority; nor is it credible that the disciples should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>have visited <a id='jer'></a>Jerusalem and returned hither in the same day, as the narrative
requires, making a distance of forty miles.</p>

<p>AMWÁS, OR NICOPOLIS, THE TRADITIONAL SITE OF EMMAUS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Just as the sun was setting we found ourselves on the summit of a
hill. Below us was a tangle and labyrinth of valleys running one into
another. On the opposite hill the sun was resting before he “hasted to go
down.” Our camp was pitched on the edge of a brook in the bottom of the
valley where mists and shadows were already gathering thick and heavy.
It was the <span class='sc'>Valley of Ajalon</span>, where Joshua commanded the sun to stand
still. Again the topography illustrated and confirmed the narrative. Joshua,
encamped at Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, received intelligence that five
kings of the Amorites had attacked the Gibeonites with whom he had just
before made an alliance,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and who demanded instant succour. “Slack not
thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help
us.” Though only just before the army had required three days to reach
the city,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Joshua at once ordered a forced march which he accomplished in
the course of a single night. He found the Amorites besieging Gibeon, the
site of which is marked by the village of Geeb, some distance to the north-east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of where we stand. Taken by surprise at this sudden and unlooked-for
attack, they were “discomfited,” “slain with a great slaughter,” and “chased
along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon,” now, Beit ’Ur el-Foka, Beth-horon
the upper, on the summit of a hill looking over the plain of Sharon.
Here they seem to have made a stand, but were driven down the steep
rocky declivity leading to the lower Beth-horon, now Beit ’Ur et-Tahta,
at the foot of the ravine. As in wild panic they were rushing down
the precipitous descent, a hailstorm, perhaps, accompanied by a fall of
meteoric stones, added to their confusion and dismay. Slipping and falling
from rock to rock, the discomfited host endeavoured to escape along
the valleys below us, hotly pursued by the victorious army. The kings
took refuge in a cave, the entrance to which was blocked up by the
pursuers who still pressed on after the flying foe. The sun had reached his
meridian and stood over Gibeon, the pale crescent moon over Ajalon. Will
the shades of evening close upon them when the victory is incomplete, giving
opportunity to the Amorites to escape among the defiles which run in every
direction, or to rally in the darkness? “Then spake Joshua to the Lord ...
and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and
thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon
stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.” The
victory was complete; the kings were brought out from the hiding-place and
slain. “And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at
Gilgal.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after leaving the valley of Ajalon we reach the village of Kuryet-el-enab,
better known at the present day as Abu-Gosh, from the robber chief
who for nearly a quarter of a century kept the Turkish power at bay, and
levied blackmail on the whole district. It is identified with tolerable certainty
as the ancient <span class='sc'>Kirjath-Jearim</span> (<i>the city of forests</i>), though the forests from
which it took its name have long since disappeared. Originally a city of the
Gibeonites,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> it subsequently became one of the border towns marking the frontier
between Judah and Benjamin. It is in consequence frequently mentioned in
the mapping out and allotment of the land by Joshua.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The accuracy of what
has been well called “The Doomsday Book of the Israelites” is shown by the
fact that these ancient records still afford invaluable aid in settling the topography
of Palestine. At Kirjath-Jearim the Ark rested for twenty years
after being recovered from the hands of the Philistines and before its removal
to Jerusalem by David. It was in this “city of forests” that the royal psalmist
found it in “the fields of the wood” and brought it with songs of praise to
the place he had prepared for its reception.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> It was very interesting to read the
narrative of the bringing hither of the Ark and compare it with the surrounding
scenery. “And the men of Kirjath-Jearim came, and fetched <em>up</em> the Ark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab <em>in the hill</em>.” The village
stands on the slope of a hill trending down towards Ain-Shems, the ancient
Beth-Shemesh. A hill rises above the town, and the ruins of an ancient church
which stands on its summit may not improbably mark the site of “the house
of Abinadab.”</p>

<p class='re-caption'>[<i>From a Sketch by Mr. F. E. Blackstone.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after leaving Abu-Gosh we descend into a broad deep valley,
the Wady es-Sumt, enclosed by rounded hills, terraced and covered with olives
to the very summit. A brook, swollen by winter rains into a torrent, brawls
over a bed of pebbles brought down by it from the rocks above. It
is the <span class='sc'>Valley of Elah</span>, along which the hosts of the Amorites fled after
their defeat at Beth-horon, and where the ruddy stripling from Bethlehem
confronted and slew the giant of Gath.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The hills curve round, forming
an amphitheatre, in which, as “the Philistines stood on a mountain on
one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other, and there was a
valley between them,” the hostile armies would be able to watch the combat
between their chosen champions. Bethlehem is only about ten miles distant,
and the young shepherd boy, who “rose up early in the morning and left the
sheep with a keeper,” could easily reach the spot in time to see “the battle
set in array,” and hear the defiant challenge of the Philistine. Shocoh is
represented by the village of Shuweikeh; Azekah is probably the modern
Tell Zakarîya; and Gath lies at no great distance on the way down to
Ekron. David, returning to Bethlehem by the main road would pass through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>or near Jerusalem, at that time in the hands of the Jebusites; hence the
statement which has caused some perplexity to commentators, that “he took
the head of the Philistine and brought it” thither.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the valley of Elah on the way to Jerusalem the eye is arrested
by a white-walled village standing on the slope of the hill, a little way off
the road, but visible from it. Travellers going thither from Jerusalem must
turn aside as “they draw nigh unto it”; others “who would go farther,”
continue along the road, leaving it on the right. It is now called Kulon or
Kulônia, and at least a probable conjecture regards it as <span class='sc'>Emmaus</span>.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Though
there is no direct evidence of the fact, yet it fulfils all the requirements of
the narrative, which, as we have seen, the traditional site fails to do. We
know from Josephus that there was an Emmaus in this neighbourhood, and
that a Roman garrison was stationed there. The modern name of Kulônia
may not improbably represent the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colonia</span></i>, or Roman settlement. Assuming
the identification to be correct, we now, for the first time, find ourselves in
the actual footsteps of Him whose “name is above every name.” Tender,
sacred, sublime, as are all the associations of the Holy Land, they must yield
to thoughts of Him who was David’s son and yet his Lord; who was of the
seed of Abraham, and yet could say, “Before Abraham was I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>About seven miles, “sixty furlongs,” from Kulônia we reach the summit
of a broad plateau. Turning a corner of the road, a huge Russian monastery
and church, with several smaller buildings around, all new, crude and raw in
colour, obstruct the view in front. On the right is a ravine, beyond which
a series of barren wind-swept hills stretch to the horizon. Just behind the
monastery is a Turkish barrack, and then a line of dim grey venerable
walls. There is nothing imposing or impressive in the sight, and yet every
traveller halts; even the most frivolous are awed into silence. Not a few
gaze with tears upon the scene. It is <span class='sc'>Jerusalem</span>! The moment when its
sombre turreted walls, minarets, and domes break, for the first time, upon
the eye is one never to be forgotten. The dream, the hope of a lifetime
has been fulfilled. The one thought, “Our feet shall stand within thy gates,
O Jerusalem,” swallows up every other. I was not surprised; I was not
disappointed. The outward features of the landscape were scarcely seen. The
present was lost sight of and forgotten in the memories of the past. This
was the city of the Lord of Hosts! Here He chose to dwell between the
cherubim! Here my Lord was crucified!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not our plan to make any stay in Jerusalem at present. We
should return in a few days. I contented myself, therefore, with entering at
the Jaffa gate, and clattering for a few hundred feet along the stony street.
Then, retracing my steps, I rode round a portion of the southern wall
and descended into the Valley of Hinnom to rejoin my companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing the Pool of Gihon, and leaving the Hill of Evil Counsel on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>our left, an extensive view opens before us. The eye ranges over a vast
expanse of rocky hills, covered with a sparse vegetation. Several fortified
and castellated convents—Greek, Latin, Copt and Armenian—remind
us that Christianity is but encamped as a foreigner in the land which gave
it birth, suggest too the wild and lawless character of the people where the
monks have to live as garrisons holding fortresses in an enemy’s country.
Several villages, each with a name which recalls events of biblical history,
come into view. One of these, conspicuous from its size and position, is
Bethlehem, which we hope to visit on our return from Hebron.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>TOMB OF RACHEL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>An hour and a quarter after leaving Jerusalem, we approach a square
white-washed building surmounted by a dome. Except for its greater size,
it differs in no respect from the ordinary tombs of Moslem saints, so numerous
throughout Egypt and Syria. It is the birth-place of Benjamin, and
the <span class='sc'>Tomb of Rachel</span>. The present edifice is modern, but the identity of
the site is undoubted, being clearly marked out by the inspired narrative,
“And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come
to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.... And it
came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his
name Ben-oni (<i>i.e.</i> the son of my sorrow): but his father called him Benjamin
(<i>i.e.</i>, the son of my right hand). And Rachel died, and was buried in the
way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> How deeply and permanently
this event, with all its details, was impressed on the mind of the
bereaved patriarch, may be gathered from the fact, that, on his death-bed, he
recalled all the circumstances: “As for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel
died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a
little way to come unto Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way of
Ephrath.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> It has been said that the roads in the East never vary, but
continue to follow precisely the same course age after age. It will be
noticed that, in both accounts of the death of Rachel, stress is laid upon
the fact that she died and was buried “in the way.” The tomb of Rachel
still stands on the roadside.</p>

<p class='c000'>An hour beyond Rachel’s tomb brings us to a fertile, but desolate and
unpeopled valley, in which stands a large old castellated khan, near which
are three remarkable cisterns of great size, constructed with solid masonry,
the joints of which have the peculiar bevel which is regarded as characteristic
of old Jewish or Phœnician work. Their dimensions are as follows:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c011'>They are fed by three perennial springs, which gush from the rock into a
cavern lined with masonry in the hill above the khan, access to which is
gained by a narrow doorway, and are conducted by a subterranean conduit
into the upper pool. In the valley, below the lower pool, on the way to
Bethlehem and Jerusalem, are traces of ancient gardens and orchards. Fruit
trees are growing wild; the hills on either side are terraced; and there
are indications of fountains, waterfalls, and arbours having been constructed
amongst the rocks. The name by which they are known, Solomon’s Pools,
leads the mind to the passage in Ecclesiastes: “I made me great works;
I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me gardens and
orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits: I made me
pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Though
we have no positive proof that these are relics of “the glory of Solomon,”
the probability is strong in favour of their being so.</p>

<p class='c000'>About four hours and a half south of Solomon’s Pools, stands a city,
which contests with Damascus the distinction of being the oldest in the world;
and which, in historical interest, may almost vie with Jerusalem itself—Hebron.
It has been said that the road thither is unique, as being absolutely the worst
in the world. It would, however, be more correct to say that for the greater
part of the distance there is no road at all. A track, indistinctly marked,
crosses hill and valley, over smooth sheets of slippery rock, winding in and out
amongst piles of stones, or leading into treacherous quagmires. Here and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>there traces of Roman pavement may be detected, or a mass of limestone rock
has been cut through. In all other respects the rugged mountain-sides remain
unchanged. The scenery is monotonous and depressing. A succession of bare,
rounded hills, absolutely treeless, and apparently hopelessly barren, stretch to
the horizon in every direction. There is nothing to break the solitude, save
now and then a string of camels on their way between Hebron and Jerusalem.
Not a house, or sign of human habitation, is visible.</p>

<p>SOLOMON’S POOLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The prevailing grey tone of the landscape, save where a strip of brilliant
green in the valleys marks the line of a watercourse, adds to the monotony.
And yet this district, now so lonely and desolate, must at some period have
been both populous and prosperous. Ruins of ancient villages are to be seen
on every hand; and
the lines of stones,
which now add to
the sterile aspect of
the hill-sides, prove
on examination to be
the remains of artificial
terraces, by
means of which the
steepest slopes and
the scantiest soil were
once brought under
cultivation.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly before
reaching Hebron the
road passes along a
valley, the sides of
which are covered
with figs, olives, pomegranates, peaches, and apricots. But the extent and
luxuriance of the vineyards form its most striking feature. It is the <span class='sc'>Valley
of Eshcol</span>, where the spies “cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes,
and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates,
and of the figs.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The fruit of Eshcol is famous to this day for
its size and flavour throughout Southern Palestine; and as we looked around
on the expanse of orchards and olive groves and vineyards, it was easy to
understand the favourable report of the spies—“We came unto the land
whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this
is the fruit of it.” We are in the territory of Judah, and as we observed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>size of the vine-stubs, and the abundance of their produce, the prophetic
blessing of Jacob could not be forgotten, “Binding his foal unto the vine, and
his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his
clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth
white with milk.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>RUINS OF TEKOA, ON THE WAY DOWN TO HEBRON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We noticed, too, the vineyards walled round with stones, collected from
within the enclosure, each with its wine-fat and a tower, constructed, like the
fences, with stones and masses of rock which would otherwise have marred the
soil; and the words of Isaiah found an exact illustration, “My wellbeloved
hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced it, and gathered out the
stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
midst of it, and also made a winepress therein.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The parable spoken by
our Lord was, at the same time, vividly illustrated. “There was a certain
householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged
a winepress in it, and built a tower.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The grapes are either eaten fresh, or dried into raisins, or boiled down
into grape-honey (<i>dibs</i>), or made into wine. Of course the Mohammedans
leave the production and consumption of the latter to the Jewish and Christian
residents, its use being forbidden by the Koran. I found the wine of Hebron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>strong, but very sweet, being loaded with grape-honey, and apparently flavoured
with spices, tasting much like the elder-berry wine which is made in country
districts in England.</p>

<p>DISTANT VIEW OF HEBRON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The first view of Hebron is very striking. It is picturesquely situated
among groves of olives, on the slope of a hill at the southern end of the
valley of Eshcol. Solidly built with blocks of grey weather-beaten stone, it
has an appearance of great antiquity as befits a city reared “seven years
before Zoan in Egypt.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Zoan has disappeared, but Hebron still stands, with
a history which goes back for more than three thousand years. The ancient
names of the city—“Kirjath-Arba, the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
city is Hebron,”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> are no longer used. But its modern name is strangely impressive
and affecting. It is now known as El-Khulil, that is, <em>The Friend</em>, leading
the mind back to the
title given to the illustrious
patriarch by
God Himself, “Abraham,
My friend.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> It
is by this name that
he is always known
throughout the Mohammedan
world; and
the epithet has passed
over from the patriarch
himself to the city
with which he was so
intimately associated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very early in the
life of Abraham we
find him encamped “in
the plain of Mamre,
which is in Hebron, and he built there an altar unto the Lord.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> He and his
nephew Lot had parted. Lot had chosen the well-watered and luxuriant
plain of the Jordan, which lies just across the range of hills on the western
slope of which Hebron stands; and Abraham had remained on the elevated
<i>plateau</i> which was henceforth to be inseparably associated with himself and his
descendants.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was whilst encamped at Mamre that he received tidings of the disaster
which had fallen upon his nephew. Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, with his
allies, had attacked and sacked the cities of the plain, had carried away Lot
as captive, and, laden with spoil, was returning to his own country. Abraham
at once collected his clan, “born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and pursued them unto Dan,”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> the extreme northern city of Palestine. A
battle was fought, in which Chedorlaomer was slain, his army routed, and Lot
with his family delivered from captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years now pass by, in which the names of Hebron and Mamre do
not occur, though it is probable that some of the incidents recorded happened
there. Then “the Lord appeared unto him in the plain of Mamre: and he
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lift up his eyes and looked,
and, lo, three men stood by him.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The prompt hospitality of the patriarch
was just such as would be offered by an Arab sheikh at the present day.
Travellers have delighted to illustrate the narrative by narrating similar incidents
in their own experience. Soon the mysterious visitants “rose up from
thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them
on the way”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> over the ridge of hills which divided Mamre from the doomed
city. Two of them seem to have continued their journey, “and went toward
Sodom.” The third remains—it is the Lord himself, the Angel of the
Covenant. He discloses to Abraham the impending destruction of the cities
of the plain, which would involve Lot and his family in the general ruin.
The patriarch, who had once before rescued his nephew from the cruelty of
man, now ventures to interpose between him and the judgments of God.
His fervent prayer having reached its end, “the Lord went His way, as
soon as He had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto
his place.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> With the dawn of day we find him an eager watcher from the
hill-top above his tent. “Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place
where he stood before the Lord: and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
country went up as the smoke of a furnace.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> It affords an interesting confirmation
of this part of the narrative that from the summit of the hill just above the
traditional site of Mamre a view may be gained, through a notch of the
dividing ridge, right down into the valley beyond, with its scene of weird
desolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hebron next comes before us as the scene of bereavement. “And
Sarah died in Kirjath-Arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and
Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.” He, to whom
the whole land had been promised in “a covenant which could not be broken,”
possessed not a foot of soil in it, and he must buy a grave, “that I may
bury my dead out of my sight.” The negotiation with the sons of Heth
which followed, is finely characteristic of the courtesy, the generosity, and
the practical wisdom of the bereaved patriarch. The purchase of the cave
of Machpelah is effected and the place of burial is transferred, the narrative
of the completion of the purchase being recorded in terms, the precision of
which is like that of a legal document.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Sarah is buried there, and “then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and
full of years; and was gathered to his people. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael
buried him in the cave of Machpelah.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet again we read that “Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre,
unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. And Isaac gave
up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full
of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Here Jacob lived after the death of his father, and hence he sent the
beloved son of his beloved Rachel to visit his brethren at Shechem.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Here, too,
he buried Leah,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> as Sarah and Rebekah had already been laid side by side.
And “he gave commandment concerning his bones,” that the same sacred

<p class='c000'>We have already seen that the spies, starting from Kadesh-Barnea,

Caleb the son of Jephunneh, faithful amongst the faithless, had rebuked the
fears of the people and “wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.” To him
and his heirs Hebron had been promised as the reward of his fidelity. After
the defeat of the Ammonites by Joshua, when the city was stormed and sacked
by the victorious Israelites, Caleb claimed the fulfilment of this promise,
“And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Hebron for an inheritance.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p>POOL OF HEBRON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For some time onward, Hebron receives only slight and passing mention.
But in this old royal city, hallowed by so many associations, David established
his throne on the death of Saul, and here he reigned as king of Judah for
“seven years and six months.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Soon Hebron again comes before us as a
place of burial. Abner, falling a victim to the vengeance and ambition of
Joab, who slew him in the gate of the city, received a magnificent funeral,
and king David himself followed the bier, and they buried Abner in Hebron,
and the king lifted up his voice and wept, and all the people wept.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> A tomb
is yet shown and regarded with great reverence as that of Abner.</p>

<p class='c000'>One spot in the suburbs of Hebron we are enabled to associate with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>residence of David here. There are two tanks or pools just outside the
city gate, evidently of great antiquity. It was here that he executed the
murderers of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul. “And David commanded his
young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and
hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of
Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>When the tribes of Israel came down to Hebron, and made David king
over all the land, the interest and importance of the city ceased. Only
once again does it appear in history. Here Absalom came and raised the
standard of revolt against his father, and “sent spies throughout all the tribes
of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall
ye say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The name does not occur in the
New Testament, nor does our Lord appear to have visited it in the course
of his ministry; but on the flight into Egypt, when Joseph “arose and took
the young child and his mother by night,”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a> they must have passed through
the city and probably rested here on the first night of the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great and various as is the interest associated with Hebron, that interest
culminates in the cave of Machpelah. Here lie the bodies of the three great
patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives—Sarah, Rebekah, and
Leah. Mohammedan tradition affirms that the embalmed body of Joseph, likewise,
rests here, and his cenotaph is in the mosque over the cave, with those
of the other patriarchs.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is thus the most interesting <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campo Santo</span></i> in the world, and shares
with Jerusalem the distinction of being regarded with reverence alike by Jews,
Christians, and Mohammedans.
If it were possible for us to
ascertain with certainty the sepulchre
of our Lord, we should
approach it with yet deeper
feelings of awe and reverence,
though He lay there only for
thirty-six hours. But in seeking
the place “where the Lord
lay,” we have nothing to guide
us but vague conjecture and dubious
tradition. Here, however,
the identification is absolute and
beyond the reach of scepticism.
Guarded with superstitious care
for more than three thousand years, we can feel complete confidence that
“the Father of the faithful” and “the Friend of God” lies here with his
sons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entrance to the cave appears to have been in the face of a projecting
mass of rock—there are many such round Hebron—which rose in the field
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of Ephron the Hittite. The trees which bordered it<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a> were probably co-extensive
with the walls which now enclose the Haram of the Mosque. At a very
early period, probably not later than the times of David or Solomon, an edifice
was erected over the cave. The stones are of great size, with the characteristic
Jewish bevel. Dr. Wilson measured one which was thirty-eight feet in
length. The architecture is peculiar, being neither Saracenic nor Christian. A
series of flat pilasters run round the sides. From the main entrance a flight
of stone steps runs up between the outer wall and the mosque. We thus
rise from the bottom of the cliff in the face of which was the entrance of
the cave up to the top. Into the cave itself no one is allowed to enter.
Even the mosque is guarded with jealous care. No Jew or Christian had
been permitted to set foot within it, until, after immense difficulty, permission
was granted to the Prince of Wales and his suite in the year 1862.
Within the last few years the severity of the restriction has been somewhat
relaxed. In the year 1873, I was allowed to go about halfway up the
flight of steps outside the mosque and to put my hand through a hole in
the wall, which I was told led into the cave. I was then led round the outside
on to the roof, that I might look down through the lattice-work of a tower into
the mosque. All, however, was perfectly dark, and I could see nothing. The
locality of the shrines was pointed out to me, which agreed with the description
given by Dean Stanley in the narrative of his visit with the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the return from Hebron, a slight detour by a road leading through
vineyards brings us to a magnificent tree known as <span class='sc'>Abraham’s Oak</span>. Here
according to tradition, Abraham sat at the door of his tent, when he received
the visit of the angels.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a> It is a stately Syrian oak, of the species known to the
Arabs as <i>Sindiân</i>. Though of great age it is obviously later than the Christian
era. Yet it well deserves a visit, not only for its great size and beauty, but
as the last survivor of the grove of oaks, which stood here in Patriarchal
and Hebrew times. It measures twenty-three feet round the trunk, and its
branches cover an area in one direction of fifty feet, and of ninety feet in
another. Its situation answers admirably to the biblical description of Mamre,
being “before” or “over against” Machpelah, whilst from the hill above it a
view, already referred to,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a> of the plain of Sodom is gained. Here, therefore, I
should fix the site of Mamre rather than at Rhamet el Khulil (the Hill of
the Friend), which stands some distance to the north.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c009'>IT was a brilliant morning in early spring
as we rode along the hill-side over the
Wady Urtas from Solomon’s Pools to
<span class='sc'>Bethlehem</span>. The turf was vividly
green, gemmed with innumerable flowers.
Orchards of peach, apricot, and pomegranate
with their white and scarlet
blossoms, succeeded one another in an
unbroken series along the valley. The
conduit, which conducts the water from
Solomon’s Pools to Jerusalem, and which
in ancient times supplied the Temple, was
open in various places, and we could see
the crystal stream flash past on its way to “make glad the city of God.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
The Jebel Fureidis, a steep conical mountain, visible from almost every
point in Southern Palestine, formed a striking object in the landscape.
“The little hills rejoice on every side; the pastures are clothed with flocks;
the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also
sing.”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Wherever we turn our eyes the words of the Psalmist are suggested
as the aptest description of the scenery. It was easy to see where the Shepherd
of Bethlehem drew the materials for his poetry.</p>

thousand inhabitants, all Christians. They are, however, a turbulent, quarrelsome
set, ever fighting amongst themselves or with their neighbours. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the disturbances which take place so frequently at Jerusalem, it is said that
the ringleaders are commonly found to be Bethlehemites. The women are
remarkable for personal beauty. I saw more handsome faces here in a few
hours than elsewhere in the East in many days. The dress, which is peculiar,
is very becoming. A sort of tiara of some bright metal encircles the head
over which is folded a white cloth which hangs down upon the shoulders.
The men are strong, lithe, well-built fellows, and I saw several young shepherds,
who were models of manly vigour. Here, as elsewhere in the East, the
pastoral pipe is in constant use. The shepherd-lad makes it for himself,
shaping the mouth-piece out of some hard wood, and using a hollow reed for
the pipe. I cannot say much in praise of the music they produce.</p>

surmounted by higher hills, however, the view from it is not very extensive.
Jerusalem, though only six miles distant, is hidden by an intervening height.
But through the valleys stretching away eastward to the Dead Sea, fine views
are gained of the mountains of Moab, and from the flat roof of the Latin
Convent part of the Dead Sea itself is visible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nearly a hundred years must have elapsed before we hear again of Bethlehem,
for the grandson of Boaz and Ruth is now an old man.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> He is the

courage. Bears descend from the neighbouring mountains. Lions have
disappeared, but in the days of David they came up from their lairs in the

<p>ENTRANCE TO CAVE OF ADULLAM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>His chequered fortunes now lead him away from Bethlehem and we hear
of him no more in his actual birth-place. But the cave of Adullam was
not far distant. The limestone rocks of the district abound in caves,
many of them of great size. The one which is said by tradition to have been
the retreat of David and his followers is about five miles from Bethlehem,
near the base of Jebel Fureidis or the Frank Mountain already spoken
of as so striking an object in the landscape. It is approached by a savage
ravine, after which a steep ascent leads upward by a path so narrow that
a handful of brave men might keep a whole army at bay. The entrance
to the cave is by a small opening through which only a single person can
pass at a time. This leads to a series of chambers, some large enough to
hold several hundred men.
A perfect labyrinth of galleries
and passages, never fully
explored, stretch in every
direction, and are said by the
Arabs to go as far as Tekoa.
In one of them is a large
cistern, supplied, probably, by
filtration through the rock
above. The largest chamber
has an arched roof with numerous
recesses in the sides,
reminding visitors of a gothic
cathedral. Here David, living
in the midst of his own clan,
would be promptly warned of
the approach of danger, and
could easily receive supplies
of food. The summit of the
hill above commands a view
of the whole surrounding district,
so that the movements
of his enemies could be
watched in every direction. His familiarity with the wild glens and strongholds
of the district, gained whilst keeping his father’s sheep, would prove an immense
advantage in flying from his pursuers. And the proximity to Moab secured for
him a safe retreat if hard pressed. In Moab, too, he found friends and relatives,
in virtue of his descent from “Ruth the Moabitess,” to whom he committed
his parents when they were exposed to danger from the vindictive fury of Saul.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
The phrase that “his brethren and all his father’s house went <em>down</em> thither unto
him,”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a> which at first suggests a difficulty, from the fact that the cave is high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>up on the mountain-side, finds an easy explanation as we observe that from
Bethlehem they must first descend into the Wady Urtas and wind along down
the ravine. In the references to this cave, as everywhere in Scripture, the narrative
is in such exact and minute agreement with the topography of the district
that it could only have been written by an eye-witness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was whilst hiding here with his wild and outlawed followers that the
touching incident occurred of his longing for the “water of the well of
Bethlehem, that is at the gate.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a> The worn and weary fugitive who compares
himself to “a partridge hunted upon the mountains,”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a> goes back to the
peaceful happy days of his shepherd life. He remembers the time when,
leading his flocks homeward in the evening after a day of sultry heat on the
mountain-side, he had quenched his
thirst at the familiar well, just as
we had seen the shepherds doing on
the same spot. Were ever days so
happy! Was ever water so sweet!
The “three mighty ones,” eager to
gratify the faintest wish of their beloved
chief, break through the beleaguering
host of the Philistines, draw
the water from the well, and return.
The hero, reproaching himself for his
selfish wish, that had “put in jeopardy
the lives of these men,” refuses
to drink thereof, and pours it out for
“a drink-offering to the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Only once again does the name
of Bethlehem occur in Old Testament
history. The reference, though
slight and incidental, has an important
bearing on the site of the
Nativity. When David was flying
from his rebellious son Absalom into
the region beyond the Jordan,
amongst those who showed kindness to the “dim discrowned king” was
Barzillai the Gileadite.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a> When the rebellion had been crushed, and the king was
about to return to his own land, Barzillai accompanied him across the Jordan.
The grateful monarch invited the old man to go up with him to Jerusalem as
his guest. Barzillai declined the honour, pleading his advanced age, his growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>weakness, his failing sight, saying, “How long have I to live, that I should
go up with the king unto Jerusalem? I am this day fourscore years old: and
can I discern between good and evil? Can thy servant taste what I eat or
what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
women? Wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord
the king? Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and
why should the king recompense
it me with such
a reward? Let thy servant,
I pray thee, turn
back again, that I may
die in mine own city,
and be buried by the
grave of my father and
of my mother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the honour
which he declines for
himself he solicits on behalf
of his son Chimham,
who accompanied
David on his return to
Jerusalem.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a> Chimham
seems to have been
treated with peculiar
favour, and adopted into
the family of the king;
for David, on his death-bed,
specially commended
him to the care of Solomon,
and requested that
he be of “those that eat
at his table.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a> We find
further that he came into
possession of property
in or near Bethlehem,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
which he transmitted to his descendants, for in the prophecies of Jeremiah
“the habitation of Chimham which is by Bethlehem” is spoken of as a place
familiarly known. That this formed part of the patrimony of David, given to
him as an adopted son, is highly probable, for in no other way can we understand
a Gileadite permanently owning land at Bethlehem.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>INTERIOR OF KHAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the word, translated “house” in Jeremiah, where the Jews assembled
on their way down into Egypt, means a khan or caravanserai. Elsewhere, it
is translated “inn.” What then are we to understand by the khan of Chimham?
It is, and always has been, the custom throughout the East for places
to be provided for travellers—one in each village—where they might halt
for the night. They are generally at distances of six or seven miles, so
as to allow of an easy day’s march from one to another. Bethlehem thus
formed the first stage from Jerusalem, on the way to Egypt. The duty
and honour of providing and maintaining these khans devolved upon the
sheikh or head man of the village, who was empowered to levy a tax
upon the villagers for their support. Sometimes only a space of ground was
staked out and fenced with thorns, so as to furnish protection against thieves
and wild beasts. But often a wealthy sheikh would erect a substantial
edifice, either defraying the cost himself or seeking aid in the work from the
inhabitants. It seems almost certain, therefore, that Chimham either became
Sheikh of Bethlehem, or else that, out of gratitude to his benefactor, he built
a khan on a portion of the land he received from the king. Of these, the
former is the more probable, and more in accordance with the custom of the
country. One thing, however, seems clear, that long after the time of David,
“the inn” at Bethlehem was well known as the khan of Chimham, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>it stood on land which had descended by inheritance from Boaz to Jesse, to
David, and to David’s adopted son.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Here was to be fulfilled the prophecy of
Micah, “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto Me that is to be
ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We thus come to that event, the glory of which transcends every other
which has yet passed under our review. Here the Eternal God veiled yet
manifested Himself in human form. The King of Glory is found “as a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.” Omnipotence slumbered
within an infant’s arm. Omniscience lay concealed beneath an infant’s brow.
In the plain below us, the shepherds were keeping their flocks by night, when
they heard the angelic anthem, “Glory to God in the highest, peace on
earth, good will to men.” Up that steep rocky path they came to see this
great sight. Over that mountain-side the Wise Men brought their gifts of
gold and frankincense and myrrh to pay homage to “the Desire of all nations.”
As we stand in the rock-hewn Chapel of the Nativity gazing upon the silver
star on the floor, and read the words <span class='sc'>Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus
natus est</span>, even the most cold and apathetic can scarcely refrain from tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>But is this the actual spot? Do we really stand on the very place
where the Virgin “brought forth her first-born son and called His name
Jesus”? There is everything in the surroundings of the place to awaken
scepticism. This series of tawdrily decked chapels in which all the great
events which have happened in Bethlehem are huddled together within one
building almost compel incredulity. Here, for instance, is the altar of the
Holy Innocents, and we are asked to believe that the remains of twenty
thousand infants, slain by Herod, lie buried close by the place of the nativity,
and we are shown the preserved tongue of one of them! However willing
we may be to accept the tradition, as to the site, we find it difficult to
do so when it is mixed up with such preposterous legends as these.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet the evidence for its authenticity is strong, though not quite conclusive.
The church stands upon a spot, just outside the village, which the inn
or khan is very likely to have occupied. The “house of Chimham by Bethlehem”
was well known to the Jews, as we have seen, and when the khan of a
village has been once established it is seldom that its site is changed. It continues
to occupy the same spot from age to age. We know that so early as
the second century, Justin described our Lord’s birth-place as “a cave near
Bethlehem.” And Jerome himself, a native of Syria and familiar with the
customs and traditions of the country, took up his abode in an adjacent cave,
that he might be near his Lord’s birth-place. The fact that the Chapel of
the Nativity is a grotto, though calculated to excite suspicion, is not of itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>fatal. It is by no means improbable that a cave contiguous to the inn
might have served the purpose of a stable. It should further be remembered
that the church may stand upon the site of the inn even though the Chapel
of the Nativity has been placed in a cave in accordance with an erroneous
and misleading superstition. Dean Stanley, summing up the evidence for
and against the authenticity of the site, concludes with the remark, “There
remains the remarkable fact that the spot was reverenced by Christians as
the birth-place of Christ two centuries before the conversion of the empire—before
that burst of local religion which is commonly ascribed to the visit of
Helena.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst feeling that the balance of probability is in favour of the
authenticity of the site, there was one consideration which made me wish to
come to a different conclusion. The degrading superstition and the disgraceful
discord which prevail here are a scandal to the birth-place of
Christianity. Anything more alien to the spirit of the Prince of Peace can
scarcely be conceived than the bitter hostility which rages amongst the three
confessions—Latin, Greek, and Armenian—which share the sacred shrine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The church—a noble edifice, with stately columns, probably brought from the
Temple at Jerusalem—is no longer used for worship. It is held by a
garrison of Turkish soldiers stationed to prevent bloodshed amongst the
monks and the pilgrims. Passing along the subterranean gallery, through
the long series of gaudy chapels, acts of idolatry are witnessed the grossness
of which recalls the fetish worship of Africa. Even a coldly scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>geographer like Ritter cannot refrain from exclaiming, “Bethlehem has
thus become a sacred name and a sacred place, although it is so poor and
mean and unimportant; but unfortunately, to many who visit it, its higher
significance is lost: they kiss the wood of the manger, but it is mere dry
wood to them—they miss the living spirit which once began that earthly
career there which had been prepared for it from before the foundation of
the world.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p>THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Bethlehem on the east, the road winds down a rocky slope,
past fields of wheat and barley and terraced vineyards. Innumerable sheep
and goats are seen on the hills around as in the days of Boaz and David.
At the foot a level plain is reached, affording good pasturage, and dotted
over with clumps of olive trees. This is called the Shepherds’ Field, from the
tradition that here they were keeping their flocks by night when the angels
appeared to them. Soon the scenery becomes wild and desolate. In no part
of the world have I seen anything with which to compare it. If the chalk-downs
of the South of England were denuded of grass, were heaved up and
tossed about in the throes of an earthquake, and the sides of the hills thus
formed were cut into ravines by the fury of winter torrents, it would afford
some illustration of the weird desolation of this Wilderness of Judea. The
gorge of the Kedron runs steeply down from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea,
a descent of nearly four thousand feet. The wadies which seam the
mountain-sides are dry in the summer, but in the winter form the beds
of roaring torrents. Now and then a glimpse of the Dead Sea is gained—the
deep blue of its waters gaining an additional intensity from the red or
purple of the mountains of Moab, which form the background of the
landscape. The black tents of the Bedouin, their flocks and herds feeding
on the mountain-sides, an Arab horseman, or a string of camels with their
noiseless tread, are the only signs of life in this region of sterility.</p>

<p class='c000'>In about three hours from Bethlehem, the <span class='sc'>Convent of Mar Saba</span> is
reached. It stands on the edge of the gorge of the Kedron, here from a
thousand to twelve hundred feet deep, the rocky sides of which are almost
precipitous, and at the bottom of the ravine are only a few yards apart.
Looked at from beneath, parts of the building are seen to be literally clamped
to the perpendicular walls of rock, and hang perilously over the abyss.
Other portions of the edifice are constructed in chambers cut out of the
mountain-side. The labyrinth of caves, chambers, and passages is most bewildering.
Only an inmate of the convent can find his way from one part
to another. What may be called the land side of the monastery is enclosed
by a high wall of great thickness. The only entrance is by a massive gate,
through which no one is admitted unless vouched for by the Greek patriarch
at Jerusalem. Bedouin and women are not admitted at all. The former for
the obvious reason that on several occasions, having forced their way in, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>massacred all the inmates. Ladies are excluded, because, as Miss Martineau
bitterly expresses it, “the monks are too holy to be hospitable.” The rule
of the monastery is very rigid. The monks never eat meat, and subject themselves
to severe austerities. Though there is a valuable library, it seems to be
entirely unused; indeed, a majority of the ascetics are unable to read, and
their only recreation consists in drinking <i>raki</i>, and in feeding the birds and
Jackals, which are very numerous.</p>

<p>CONVENT OF MAR SABA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Only once, when I crossed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mer de Glace</span></i> at midnight, have I seen
anything to compare with the wild, unearthly impressiveness of one view
of this famous monastery. We had encamped at nightfall about a couple
of miles above Mar Saba. The stars were shining with extraordinary
brilliancy in a cloudless sky, and the moon was just coming above the
horizon. I suggested an excursion along the bottom of the ravine, so as
to see the convent from beneath. On proposing this to the Sheikh, he
of course declared that it was impossible, no one had ever done it—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>was no road—he would not answer for our heads if we attempted
it, with much more to the same purpose. But finding us determined to
make a start, and that there was a prospect of backshish, he withdrew his
objections and despatched a party of Bedouin as guides and escort. The
bottom of the gorge was in almost total darkness, but we could see the
jagged peaks overhead, silvered with the moonlight. Stumbling along the bed
of the Kedron, now perfectly dry, winding in and out amongst huge boulders,
scrambling over masses of rock which blocked up the narrow passage, we
made our way down the valley. No sound was heard, save our own footsteps
and the howling of jackals. Every now and then, emerging silently as a
ghost from behind a projecting crag or from the mouth of a cave, a Bedouin,
armed with his long gun, would step forward, speak a few words to our
escort, and then silently disappear. At length we reached a point
immediately beneath the convent. The moon had now risen high enough to
pour a flood of intense white light upon it whilst we were still wrapped
in gloom. It seemed to be detached from earth, and to hang suspended in
the heavens. The solitary palm tree, said to have been planted by St. Saba
himself, stood out clear and distinct, every frond relieved against the deep
blue of the sky behind it. Even our Bedouin escort, usually so insensible
to natural scenery, seemed awed and impressed by the wild weird grandeur of
the view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Valley of Kidron begins its course on the east side of the
Temple at Jerusalem, and runs down to the Dead Sea, through a barren, arid,
waterless waste. It is thus the probable scene of the prophetic vision in which
Ezekiel beholds the glory of “the latter days,” when waters, issuing from
beneath the altar, shall flow eastward in an ever deepening stream, bringing
with them fertility and beauty wherever they come. “Very many trees” are
seen to spring up along its banks on either side. Reaching the bitter,
stagnant, poisonous waters of the Dead Sea, its desolate solitudes become the
haunts of busy life. Fishers spread their nets from En-Eglaim to En-Engedi,
for the fish have become as “the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.”
“And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side,
shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the
fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his
months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit
thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Reading such
promises of future blessings amid these desolate and sterile regions, we are
impressively reminded that when “the spirit be poured upon us from on high,
the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be accounted for
a forest, ... and the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of
righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The strange unique conformation of the country which we noticed as we
approached Mar Saba becomes even more extraordinary as we continue our
journey eastward. The soil consists of a soft chalk or white marl, furrowed
in every direction by a labyrinth of valleys and pits from fifty to a hundred
feet deep, cut, ages ago, by torrents long since dried up, leaving fantastic
flat-topped mounds of every conceivable shape, which Maundrell aptly compares
to gigantic lime kilns.</p>

<p>NORTHERN SHORE OF THE DEAD SEA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In a little more than three hours we find ourselves descending into the
<span class='sc'>Valley of the Jordan</span> and the <span class='sc'>Dead Sea</span>. Reaching the plain, we ride
through an extensive cane brake where the reeds are higher than our heads,
and which is the haunt of wild boars, wolves, jackals, and leopards, and
from which lions were driven out “from the swelling of Jordan.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From this point all vegetation ceases, for the bitter, acrid waters are fatal
alike to animal and vegetable life. Even sea-fish turned into the lake die
immediately.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a> The beach is strewn with trunks of trees, bones of animals,
and shells of fish brought down by the Jordan or by the winter torrents which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>come from the mountain-sides. After tossing, perhaps for centuries, in the
bitter brine, they are cast ashore so saturated with salt that the wood will
scarcely ignite, and if it burn at all, only gives a feeble blue flame. Those
gaunt skeletons of ancient trees are all the more ghastly from the fact that they
are covered by a saline deposit of which the fine glittering crystals are found
efflorescing all along the beach. It is caused by the evaporation either of
the receding waters after the winter floods, or of the spray which is flung
ashore by the winds, which rush with extraordinary violence between the
rocky walls which hem in the valley.</p>

<p>SOUTHERN SHORE OF THE DEAD SEA. EXPLORING PARTY OF LIEUT. LYNCH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the northern shore is thus a flat desolate waste, the view down
the sea, looking southward, is not wanting in a solemn grandeur and beauty.
The water, clear as crystal, is of a deep blue, almost purple; its waves are
crested with foam of a dazzling whiteness. Along the eastern shore the
mountains of Moab stand like a mighty wall, the ridges and precipices of which
slope down “in wild confusion to the shore, terminating in a series of perpendicular
cliffs, from twelve hundred to two thousand feet above the water.”
Though their outline is somewhat monotonous and unbroken, their marvellous
colouring, which varies from a delicate pink to a rich crimson, invests them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>with a magical beauty. Seen, especially in the morning or the evening
light, their tints are quite unearthly. The mountains of the western side,
though lower than those of the eastern, seldom rising above fifteen hundred
feet, are more irregular and broken, at least as seen from the northern end,
and assume forms of striking grandeur. The most characteristic feature of
the southern shore is a vast ridge of fossil salt, called Jebel Usdum, which is
cut into ravines and hollows by the action of winter torrents. Canon Tristram
describes many of these in terms which recall the glacier caves of the Alps.
The light gleaming through the roof produces an exquisite play of colour—green
and blue and white of various shades. Columns of rock salt are constantly
left standing, detached from the general mass. Travellers—forgetful of the
fact that these isolated fragments are but of short duration, and are, in the
course of a few years, washed away by the same agency which produced
them—have often identified one or another with the pillar of salt referred
to in Genesis xix. 26. Sulphur and bitumen, which are found throughout
the whole region, are very abundant, and traces of ancient igneous action are
more obvious here than elsewhere.</p>

<p>APPROACH TO ENGEDI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the general character of the scenery is one of sterility and desolation,
some of the wadies which run down to the sea are oases of the utmost
fertility and beauty. Chief among these is that of Engedi or the Kid’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>fountain. It runs out on the western side of the sea in the direction of Hebron.
Fertilised by a rill of pure water, and having an almost tropical temperature,
it forms a perfect garden. Even the Arabs, who are usually so insensible to
natural beauty, speak of it with enthusiasm. My servant Mohammed, on one
occasion gathered twenty-five different varieties of flowers in a few minutes.
Solomon sums up his description of the charms of the Shunammitess by saying,
“My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire on the vineyards of Engedi.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
The vineyards, the palms and the balsam trees, which once abounded here,
have disappeared, but traces of ancient cultivation remain to show what once
it was and might be yet again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under its original name of Hazezon-Tamar (the pruning of the palm
trees), it was the scene of the first pitched battle in an organized campaign
which history records.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Here, and in the adjoining Vale of Siddim, Chedorlaomer
defeated his rebellous tributaries, the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,
Zeboim, and Zoar, carrying away Lot and his family amongst the captives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here amongst cliffs and precipices dwelt the Kenites when Balaam,
looking across the valley from a height on the opposite side, uttered his
impassioned prophecy, and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Strong is thy dwellingplace</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</div>

      <div class='line'>Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here, too, David retired when hard pressed by Saul. He had to leave
the neighbourhood of Ziph and Maon, just as many an Arab sheikh is accustomed
to do at the present day, to escape from the tyranny, or the justice, of the
government. In these inaccessible fastnesses he was safe from pursuit, almost
from discovery. Behind him was the wilderness of Judea. Before him were
the mountains of Moab in case further retreat should seem expedient. And
here it was that heroic chief mercifully spared the life of his pitiless foe when
the “Lord had delivered him into his hand.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In more modern times the shores of the Dead Sea have been associated
with two tragic events which add to the gloomy memories which enshroud it.
Among the mountains on the eastern side, looking down upon the gorge of
the Callirhoe, is Makaur, the ancient Machærus, in which John the Baptist
took his place among “the noble army of martyrs.” Dr. Tristram, the first
European known to have visited it since the time of the Romans, says that
he found amongst the ruins “two dungeons, one of them very deep, and its
sides scarcely broken in. That these were dungeons, not cisterns, is evident
from there being no traces of cement, which never perishes from the walls of
ancient reservoirs, and from the small holes, still visible in the masonry, where
staples of wood and iron had once been fixed. One of these must surely have
been the prison-house of John the Baptist.” On the western shore stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Masada, the palace-fortress of Herod, in which was enacted the last awful
tragedy in the Jewish war of independence. Jerusalem had fallen. One
fortress after another had surrendered to the Romans. This impregnable
stronghold alone remained, held by a band of men who, with the courage of
despair, determined to die rather than to yield. The fatal moment at length
arrived at which further resistance was impossible. Eleazar, son of Judas
the Galilean, called the garrison together and urged upon them that death was
to be preferred to dishonour. Each man thereupon stabbed his wife and
children to the heart, and lying down beside those whom he loved, bared his
neck to the ten who were chosen by lot to consummate the slaughter. One of
these last survivors then slew the other nine and, having set fire to the
building, stabbed himself. When the Romans entered the breach on the
morning of Easter Day <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 73, they found nothing but corpses and smouldering

vaults, alone survived to tell the tale, nearly a thousand persons having perished.</p>

<p class='c000'>But all other historical associations with this district shrink into insignificance
in comparison with that fearful catastrophe, when the Lord overwhelmed
and destroyed the guilty cities with fire from heaven. When “Lot
lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered
everywhere, even as the garden of the Lord,”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a> he not only failed to take
account of the licentiousness and “filthy conversation of the wicked,”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> choosing
temporal wealth at the peril of his soul’s welfare; but he knew not or cared
not that the soil was one vast arsenal filled with instruments of destruction.
The cities rested upon a bed of sulphur and bitumen. They were built
and cemented from “the slime-pits of Siddim.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> When the longsuffering
of God was exhausted and “the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah was very
great and their sin very grievous,” the hour of judgment came. The
destruction may have been altogether miraculous. Or it may have been
brought about by miracle working through natural agencies. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>region is volcanic. Lightnings flashing from heaven, and the bursting forth
of the subterranean fires, may have turned the whole plain into “a burning
fiery furnace,” in which not the cities only but the very soil on which they
stood were turned into one vast sea of flame. Imagination shudders at
the awful spectacle when “the smoke of the country went up like the smoke
of a furnace.”</p>

<p>THE DEAD SEA NEAR MASADA.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exact site of the cities thus destroyed cannot be decided with
certainty. It has been commonly supposed that the Dead Sea covers the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>spot upon which they stood. Of
this, however, we have no evidence
in Scripture, and an examination
of the geology of the
district shows that it is impossible.
Those who would locate
them on the plain to the south
of the Sea, urge in proof of their
view an early and continuous
tradition to this effect, the presence
of a vast mountain of rock-salt
which breaks up into isolated
columns, the most remarkable
of which has been
called Lot’s wife, and the similarity
of names, Usdum being
identified with Sodom, Amrah
with Gomorrah, and Zuweirah
with Zoar. But the biblical
narrative rather points to the
conclusion that they stood on or
near the northern shore where
the “well-watered plain” of the
Jordan, even to this day, attracts
by its extraordinary fertility.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p>MAP OF THE DEAD SEA. SOUNDINGS IN FATHOMS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is only within the present
generation that the physical
conditions of the Dead Sea have
been subjected to scientific investigation.
Dean Stanley truly
says, “Viewed merely in a
scientific point of view, it is one
of the most remarkable spots of
the world.” At some remote
period beyond the range of history
or tradition, the Jordan
seems to have flowed onward
over what is now the elevated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>valley of Arabah into the Red Sea. By geological action, the nature of
which cannot as yet be ascertained, the whole Jordan valley has sunk, so
that the Sea of Galilee is probably six hundred feet, and the Dead Sea
about thirteen hundred feet, below the level of the Mediterranean—a
phenomenon without parallel on the earth’s surface. The sea itself is divided
into two unequal parts by a projecting tongue of land, called by the Arabs
<i>El Lisan</i> (the tongue). The northern portion is very deep; the greatest
depth being given by Lieutenant Lynch at thirteen hundred and eight feet.
Its bed, therefore, at this point would be twenty-six hundred feet below the
level of the sea. The southern portion is much shallower, nowhere exceeding
two fathoms. The depth, however, varies with the seasons. The total superficial
area is about two hundred and fifty miles, which is nearly that of the
Lake of Geneva. Its excessive density and saltness have been already referred
to. Analysis gives the following results:</p>

The river comes down from the Sea of Galilee in a turbid impetuous stream.
It has cut its channel so deeply in the marly soil, that throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>greater part of its course it is hidden from view. From any elevated point,
however, it is easy to trace its course, from the fringe of bright green
which marks it. Innumerable willows, oleanders, and tamarisks grow upon
its banks and overhang the river-bed. Hence the incident recorded of the
sons of the prophets, who, in the days of Elisha, went down to the Jordan
to cut timber, one of whom let the head of a borrowed axe fall into the
river.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

fertility and prosperity wherever they come, it is easy to understand the
scornful words of Naaman the Syrian: “Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers

</div>

<p class='c000'>Like the Dead Sea, the physical phenomena of the Jordan are absolutely
unique. Emerging from the Sea of Galilee at a probable depression of six
hundred feet below the level of the Mediterranean, it rushes along a narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>fissure of sixty miles in length; but doubling and winding as it goes, its
actual course is two hundred miles. Starting from so low a level, its current
might be expected to be slow and torpid. So far from this, it plunges over a
series of rapids,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and finally loses itself in the Dead Sea, to emerge no more,
at a depth of thirteen hundred feet below the level of the Mediterranean.
No river famous in history is so unproductive and useless. Like the Upper
Rhone, its rapid torrent and its sudden violent floods,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a> make it an object
rather of dread than delight to the dwellers on its banks. Yet, even in
these physical characteristics, we can see its admirable adaptation to the
divine purpose. The Israelites were to be cut off from intercourse with the
licentious idolaters on the east bank of the Dead Sea. A river easily
crossed, with numerous fords and bridges, would have failed to answer
this purpose. But the Jordan, though only from twenty to thirty yards
wide, offered an almost insuperable barrier to intimate association, the fords
being few and dangerous, and the floods rendering bridges almost impossible.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Crossing the plain in a westerly direction, we reach, in about an hour,
a wretched village of mud huts, dominated by a single ruinous tower.
Its modern name is Er Riha. Near it was the site of the ancient <span class='sc'>Gilgal</span>.
Here the column of stones, taken from the bed of the Jordan, was piled;
here the first camp in the promised land was pitched; here the covenant
with God was renewed by the celebration of the passover and the
circumcision of the people; here “the
manna ceased” and “they did eat of
the old corn of the land, unleavened
cakes and parched corn on the selfsame
day;” and here it was that “the
Captain of the Lord’s host,” with “a
sword drawn in his hand,” appeared to
Joshua to encourage him in the conflicts
which yet awaited him.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> It is not to
be wondered at that something of sanctity
should attach to a spot hallowed
with such memories and associations as
these. Hence we find that the Tabernacle
remained at Gilgal during the
stormy period which followed till it was
removed to its resting-place in Shiloh.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
And in after ages the people still assembled
to offer sacrifices on the spot so
memorable in their history.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a> As this
was in a certain sense the cradle, if not
the birth-place, of the national existence,
we find that it was at Gilgal that Saul
was made king,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and that the men of
Judah assembled to reinstate David upon
the throne on his return from exile.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
From the residence of Elijah and Elisha
in Gilgal, and from the events which are
recorded to have happened there, it is
clear that a school of the prophets continued to exist on the site of the ancient
sanctuary down to a late period of the monarchy.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The sad tendency to apostacy and idolatry which cast so deep a shadow
over the history of the Jews, was specially manifest on this sacred spot, for
we find Hosea and Amos singling out Gilgal for special censure and denunciation,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
teaching that no sanctity of place, no hallowed memories, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>outward influences, can avail to check the corruptions of “an evil heart of
unbelief in departing from the living God.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p>SITE OF ANCIENT JERICHO, WITH MONS QUARANTANIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>About half an hour after leaving Er Riha, we reach some mounds of
crumbling debris at the foot of a range of barren precipitous mountains, which
form the western boundary of the Jordan valley. It is the site of <span class='sc'>Jericho</span>.
The soil around it is fertile as ever. Its fountains still pour forth streams
over the “well watered” plain. Nowhere has the primæval curse fallen more
lightly. With the slightest effort on the part of man, the whole region would
become a garden. But alas! it is a desolate waste. The Bedouin lead their
flocks across the plain as did the patriarchs of old. But there is no other
sign of human life. The groves of palm trees which once stretched for miles
around the city and gave it its name,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> have disappeared. One solitary survivor
lingered up to the year 1835, but this, too, has now perished. Nothing
is left to break the depressing sense of solitude and desolation. The curse
pronounced upon the doomed city still seems to linger amongst its ruins:
“Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city of
Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his
youngest son shall he set up the gates thereof.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Standing upon the mounds which mark the site of the ancient city, and
looking eastward, we have immediately behind us the range of mountains
and table-land, which stretching westward, as far as the plains of Sharon,
formed the territory of Judah and Benjamin. Before us is the plain of the
Jordan here at its widest. The long wall-like chain of the mountains of
Moab bounds the view on the east. Numerous ravines, each of which is
memorable in the wars of the Israelites, intersect the range. The vast plains
which stretch northward and eastward afford splendid grazing ground, now
as of yore, when the flocks and herds of the Midianites wandered over them,
when “Gilead was a place for cattle” and the “oaks,” “the rams,” and “the
bulls of Bashan” were symbols of agricultural and pastoral wealth.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Looking across the valley, attention is arrested by the numerous conical
hills rising from the flat table-land which is supported by the mountain chain.
Many of these attain considerable height, not only from the plain below, but
from the plateau on which they rest. Of these, one holds a conspicuous
place in early Hebrew history. Balak, king of Moab, alarmed at the rapid
and irresistible progress of the children of Israel, and despairing of checking
their advance, sends across the Euphrates to bring thence the seer whose
incantations may seduce or overcome the mighty God who had given them
the victory. He knew not that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God is not a man that He should lie;</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither the son of man that He should repent:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Hath He said, and shall He not do it?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good ...</div>

      <div class='line'>Neither is there any divination against Israel.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He had brought the seer to the top of Pisgah, whence he might command a
view of the encampment of Israel in the plain below and of the whole
promised land. Vain are all sacrificial rites, all magical arts, all offers of wealth
and power. He who was brought to curse can only bless, “And Balaam rose
up and went to his place: and Balak also went his way.”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet again we find Israel encamped in the plains of Moab, on the eastern
bank of the Jordan. Their forty years’ wanderings are ended. They are now
to go in and possess the good land. But their heroic leader is not to go before
them. Though “a hundred and twenty years old, his eye was not dim, nor
his natural force abated.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> He might, therefore, have looked forward to
a further period of active service; at least he might have hoped to reap with
his own hand the harvest for which he had toiled and waited so many weary
years. But it was not to be. He must climb “the mountain of Nebo, to
the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho”—the very height upon which
Balaam had stood. There “the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead,
unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and
all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain
of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.”<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Ignorance
of the topography of Palestine has led many to conclude that this extended
vision was physically impossible, to be accounted for only by miracle; or
by the deniers of miracles, to be rejected as mythical and legendary. So
far is this from being the case, that modern travellers, who have been permitted
to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Stand where Moses stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And view the landscape o’er,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>have described the scene in words which only fill up the outline of the
inspired narrative. The whole extent of Palestine lies stretched out like a
map from the snowy summit of Hermon on the north, to the Mediterranean
on the west, and the granite peaks of Arabia on the south.</p>

<p class='c000'>Innumerable legends have gathered about the death of Moses on Nebo.
The Talmud abounds with them. Josephus rises to true pathos and poetry
as he describes its traditionary incidents. The Mohammedans have wild
weird myths of the war which raged amongst the spirits of good and evil
around his dying form, and they perform pilgrimages to his legendary tomb
on the mountain just above Jericho. All we know is that “Moses the
servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word
of the Lord. And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>against Beth-peor; but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.”<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a>
Even in Palestine itself there are few spots upon which the eye rests with a
deeper sense of awe, and mystery, and reverential wonder than as we look
across the Ghor of the Jordan and gaze upon this peak, glowing in the light
of the setting sun, where the prophet of the Lord breathed his last earthly
sigh, and awoke in the presence of his God.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the days of mourning for their great leader had been
accomplished, his chivalrous successor set the host in motion. Passing, probably,
down the Wady Hesban, they encamped in the valley of the Jordan. To
cross the river in the presence of their enemies would at any time have
been a difficult and dangerous operation. The fords were few, the river rapid,
the banks steep. And Jordan was now in flood. It had filled up its banks
and was absolutely impassable. Confiding, however, in divine aid, the signal
to advance is given. The priests march first, bearing with them the ark. A
mile in their rear are the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of
Manasseh fully armed, so as to resist any attack made upon them by their
foes.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a> No sooner had the feet of the priests touched the brimming waters
of the river, than the stream ceased to flow downward, being cut off at a
point nearly thirty miles above, at the city of Zaretan, leaving the bed dry
till the whole people had passed safely over. We are told, respecting the
similar miracle of the crossing of the Red Sea, that “the Lord caused the
sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night.”<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The enquiry
suggests itself whether any natural agency, working under the control of a
divine power can be suggested to account for this drying up of the Jordan.
It has been already remarked that the whole region is volcanic and subject
to earthquakes. It is, therefore, a possible conjecture that such a convulsion
of nature may have occurred at this critical moment, so that for a time the
bed of the Jordan was laid bare “from the city of Adam, that is beside
Zaretan.”<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a> We need not, however, feel any anxiety to explain these divine
interpositions by the action of natural laws. He who instituted the laws of
nature and uses them for His purposes as He pleases, can, when it seems good
to Him, dispense with them altogether. The fact of the miracle is certain,
account for it how we please: “this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous
in our eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The siege of Jericho speedily followed. The same divine power which
dried up the bed of the river (perhaps working through the same natural
agency) caused the walls of the city to “fall down after they were compassed
about seven days;” and Rahab, who had “received the spies with peace,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>was spared to be enrolled amongst the chosen people, and even in the
ancestry of our Lord, as the reward of her faith.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst still encamped near Jericho, Joshua undertook two important
military exploits. One has been already described—the relief of the city of
Gibeon and the defeat of the Amorites in the valley of Ajalon. The other
has yet to be spoken of. In the mountain range which rises immediately to
the west of the Jordan valley, are several passes which run up into the
interior of the country. At the head of one of these stood the city of Ai,
near to Bethel. It was an important stronghold, and its acquisition by the
Israelites would secure them a firm and commanding position in central
Palestine. A small detachment of men was therefore ordered to advance up
the pass and attack the city, whilst the main body remained at Jericho.
They were, however, defeated with great slaughter by the men of Ai and
had to retreat down the steep defile. The sin of Achan having been detected
and punished, a new assault was ordered by divine command, which proved
successful.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a> The acquisition of this almost impregnable post made Joshua
master of the whole of Southern Palestine, to the subjugation of which he
could now proceed at leisure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was along the same pass that, in after years, Elijah and Elisha went
up from Gilgal to Bethel and again returned to Jericho. Then crossing the
plain, they proceeded to the Jordan, whilst “fifty men of the sons of the
prophets” climbed the mountains in the rear, which command a view of the
whole region, and “stood to view afar off.” At the place where the children
of Israel had crossed the river under Joshua, the prophet took off his mantle,
and smiting the waters they again parted, so that “they two went over on
dry ground.” Here, perhaps, on the very spot where Moses had died and
was buried, Elijah “went up by a whirlwind to heaven.” The two, who
were thus mysteriously associated in their departure from earth, were to return
to it together, and on the Mount of Transfiguration, to speak with their Lord
and ours, “of the decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Yet once again was the Jordan to be miraculously parted asunder at
the same place. Elisha, returning to Jericho, smote the waters with the
mantle of Elijah, and invoking “the Lord God of Elijah, the waters parted
hither and thither, and Elisha went over.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Reference has been made to the perennial fountains which rise around
the site of Jericho. Most of the springs in the lower part of the Ghor are
either brackish, or absolutely undrinkable. From their salt and acrid character
they cause barrenness rather than fertility.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> But there is one at the foot of
the mounds which attracts attention from the purity, sweetness and abundance
of its waters. It bears to this day the name of <span class='sc'>Elisha’s Fountain</span>, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>doubtless the one of which the historian speaks as having been healed by
the word of Elisha speaking in the name of the Lord, “so the waters were
healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.”<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p>ELISHA’S FOUNTAIN, NEAR JERICHO.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst we have no precise indication of the scene of our Lord’s baptism
yet a balance of probabilities seems to confirm the accuracy of the tradition
that it was here, where the river had been thrice divided by miracle, that
the event took place. John had been preaching in the wilderness of Judea
which is just behind us. It was apparently in the same neighbourhood that
he baptized the multitudes who came to him. And it was in immediate connection
with his baptism that “Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned
from the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness, being forty days
tempted of the devil.” Though the <span class='sc'>Mons Quarantania</span>, which rises immediately
above Jericho, has only a vague tradition to associate it with the
“forty days’” fast,
yet it meets all the
requirements of the
narrative, and its
savage desolate solitude
is in keeping
with the spirit of the
event.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once only do
we read that our
Lord actually visited
Jericho. He had
crossed the Jordan
and preached “on
the further side.”<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
Recrossing the river,
either by the fords or by the Roman bridge some distance up the stream on
his way to Jerusalem, He passed through Jericho. The new city rebuilt by
Herod, was now in the height of its splendour. Josephus describes the
country round as surpassingly beautiful and fertile. Groves of palms and
balsam-trees stretched far and wide. The roads leading to and from the city
were shaded by sycamores. Having healed the blind man who sat by
the wayside begging, He conferred a yet diviner boon upon Zaccheus, who in
his eagerness to see the Lord had climbed into one of the wayside trees.
Amidst the reproachful murmurs of the people, He went to be the guest of
a man that was a sinner, bringing salvation to his house, “for the Son of
man is come to seek and save that which was lost.... And when He had
thus spoken He went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Thither let us follow Him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The road at first winds amongst the mounds of débris, so often referred
to, past ruined aqueducts and water courses which in the time of our Lord
conveyed the fertilizing streams to irrigate the plain. The mountains above
us are honey-combed by cells of hermits, who came here to live useless ascetic
lives, where our Lord had fasted, prayed, and been tempted of the devil.
Soon we begin to ascend and find ourselves skirting the edge of a savage
ravine which plunges sheer down to a depth of five hundred feet. It is the
Wady Kelt—once known as the valley of the <span class='sc'>Cherith</span>, where the prophet
Elijah was fed by ravens,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a> and, in still earlier times, as the valley of Achor
in which Achan was stoned.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000'>The ascent is continuous and steep. In a distance of about fifteen miles
we rise more than three thousand feet. Hence the constant phrases “going
<em>up</em> to Jerusalem,” “going <em>down</em> to Jericho.” On every side are steep mountains
and wild glens, the haunt of plundering Bedouins, so that a strong and
vigilant escort is needful.</p>

<p class='c000'>About midway on our journey, we pass the ruins of an ancient khan.
In accordance with oriental custom, noticed before, by which khans seldom or
never change, but occupy the same spot from age to age, a halting place for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>travellers has stood here from immemorial antiquity. This then is the inn
to which our Lord referred in his parable of the Good Samaritan. The road
then, as now, was notorious for its insecurity. Reading on the spot the
narrative of the traveller, who going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, was
stripped, wounded, and left for dead on the road-side, every incident and
detail acquired new significance and appropriateness.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this point the wild weird desolation of the earlier part of our journey
ceased, and gave place to the rounded featureless hills which characterise the
scenery of Southern Palestine. About midday we reached the Ain el Haud, or
“The Apostle’s Fountain,” and halted awhile. Before us rose a steep ascent
up which wound a rough mountain road. It was the Mount of Olives.
Reaching the summit we should look down upon Jerusalem!</p>

<p>RUINED AQUEDUCT NEAR JERICHO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I proposed to one or two of our party that we should walk on alone,
so as to indulge,
without restraint, in
the emotions which
such a view would
excite. The proposal
was heartily
agreed to, and we
started. The day
had been showery,
and, though not actually
raining at the
moment, the clouds
were black and
heavy. Scarcely
had we commenced
the ascent when
the rain began to
fall in torrents. The stiff, tenacious mud, and the slippery sheets of
rock over which the track led, made the walk very difficult; but still we
persevered. Soon a miserable, ruinous, poverty-stricken hamlet came in
view, standing on a plateau of rock in a slight depression on the hill-side.
The pasturage around it was good and abundant, and the olive groves ought
to have been a source of wealth to the inhabitants. Under a better system
of government, and with a more industrious population, it might have been
a bright and prosperous village; but now its only attraction consists in its
hallowed associations. It is Bethany—the home of Martha and Mary and
Lazarus—the one spot on earth where He who “had not where to lay his
head” found a loving welcome and a peaceful home. It has always seemed
to me to be not without meaning that our Lord, on his Ascension, “led his
disciples out as far as to Bethany,” so that the last spot his eyes looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>upon, and his feet pressed before He left the earth which rejected Him should
be the one in which He had been a loved and honoured guest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old name of Bethany has disappeared, together with the palm-trees,
which once were in such profusion as to win for it this distinctive epithet.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
The memory of the raising of Lazarus has lived so vividly in Arab legend,
that the name El-’Azirîyeh has supplanted the earlier and biblical one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course traditional sites are pointed out for all the events of the
biblical narrative. The houses of Simon and of Martha and the grave of
Lazarus are shown. The former may be dismissed without a glance or
thought. They are evidently modern erections, certainly not earlier than the
Saracenic period, and probably much more recent. But the tomb of Lazarus
may be authentic. The masonry, indeed, is modern, but the sepulchre itself,
a deep recess cut into the rock, is apparently ancient, and, so far as I could
judge, was originally a tomb. It is entered by a narrow passage, with twenty-five
steps, leading to a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubiculum</span></i>. The tradition which identifies it with “the
cave,” in which the “friend,” whom “Jesus loved” was buried, has a respectable
antiquity, going back, at least, to the time of Arculf (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 700). Whether
this be the exact spot or not, we know that very near where we stand the
memorable words were uttered: “I am the Resurrection and the Life: he
that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Escaping from the rabble of Arabs clamouring for backshish, we
resumed our journey. The rain had ceased, and a few breaks in the clouds
encouraged a hope that we might gain a view of the city not utterly
disappointing. But we were quite unprepared for the view which awaited us
on reaching the summit of Olivet. Seen under any circumstances, it is one
never to be forgotten. The deep ravine of the Kedron below us—the city
on the opposite hill, with its grey venerable walls, its broad marble platform,
in the centre of which stands the exquisite dome of the mosque of Omar—the
picturesque mass of cupolas and minarets standing out against the sky—the
surrounding valleys and hills dotted with villages and ruined towers and
olive groves—need no aid from the associations of the spot to make it a most
striking view. But when we add those associations—so sacred, so tender, so
sublime—it is not to be wondered at that every visitor feels himself at a loss
to express the emotions which it awakens.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing, however, which I had heard or read had prepared me for the
view which broke upon us as we ascended the minaret on the summit of
Olivet. The vast marble platform of the Temple, the dome of the mosque,
the roofs of El-Aksa, the innumerable cupolas and flat roofs of the city, were
all running with water from the heavy rain. Through rifts in the clouds long
slanting beams of sunlight fell upon them with a dazzling splendour. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>city flashed and shone like molten silver. All the meanness and squalor of
its degradation was lost in the radiance which veiled it. The storm-clouds
had drifted away eastward, and settled dark and heavy over the valley of the
Dead Sea, blotting it out from view by their gloomy mass. Above the line of
clouds rose the mountains of Moab, purple in the light of the descending sun.
Only one more touch of beauty, only one more suggestion of hallowed thought,
was possible. This was furnished by a rainbow—symbol of Divine mercy and
compassion—spanning the storm-cloud which hung above the valley of Sodom.
On the one side was the city of God, radiant in the “clear shining after rain;”
on the other the city of destruction, veiled in darkness and gloom, yet not
utterly abandoned by our gracious and covenant-keeping God.</p>

<p>CHURCH ON THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Impressive as is the view which bursts upon us from the summit of the
Mount of Olives, even now that Jerusalem lies in its misery and degradation, it
must have been far grander
when our Lord, on his way
from Bethany, standing upon
this very spot beheld the city
and wept over it, saying, “If
thou hadst known, even thou,
at least in this thy day, the
things which belong unto thy
peace! but now they are hid
from thine eyes.”<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> The valley
at our feet was at least sixty
feet deeper then than it is at
present. The accumulation of
débris, the result of repeated
sieges, has not only filled it up
to that extent, but has choked up the bed of the Kedron, so that it has either
ceased to flow altogether, or only trickles almost imperceptibly amongst the
stones. The trees which once clothed the hills and the gardens which lay
along the banks of the stream have disappeared. The face of the rock upon
which the Temple stands, then went down almost precipitously, so that, as
Josephus tells us, the spectator, standing upon the walls, grew dizzy as he
looked into the ravine below him. Now mounds of rubbish, through which
Captain Warren sank a shaft to the depth of a hundred feet before he
reached the virgin soil, rest against the rock and rise almost to the foot of the
walls. The Temple itself was a marvel of splendour and beauty. Built of
costly marbles, overlaid with gold, and adorned with jewels, it shone resplendently
when the light of the rising or the setting sun fell upon it, as
though another sun was setting or rising. Of all this magnificence, nothing
remains save the vast marble platform upon which it stood. Well might the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>disciples listen with reluctance or incredulity as our Lord foretold the impending
destruction of a city “beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly we descended from the summit, lingering at many points to recall
the hallowed associations of the scene, or turning aside to gain some fresh
point of view. We
remembered not only
that our Lord had
often trodden these
very paths in his
journey between
Bethany and Jerusalem,
or gone out to
spend the night upon
the Mount of Olives,
“as he was wont,”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
but that David, in
his flight from the
city “went up by
the ascent of Mount
Olivet and wept as
he went up, and had
his head covered, and
he went barefoot:
and all the people
that was with him
covered every man
his head, and they
went up, weeping as
they went up.”<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p>PLAN OF JERUSALEM, FROM THE ORDNANCE SURVEY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The city, which holds so conspicuous a place in the later Scriptures, is in
the earlier ones only referred to incidentally or obscurely. It is commonly
identified with the Salem of which Melchizedec was king; and Mount
Moriah, upon which Abraham was about to offer up Isaac, is thought to be
the same with that on which the Temple was afterwards built. Dean
Stanley argues strongly against this view, and would transfer the city of
Melchizedec to a town, the site of which is marked by a village still bearing
the name of Salem, near the ancient Shechem. The sacrifice of Isaac he
would likewise place in the same neighbourhood on the summit of Gerizim.
Though his arguments are weighty and deserve serious consideration, they
cannot be accepted as conclusive. That the king of Jerusalem, in the days
of Joshua,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a> bore a name or title almost the precise equivalent of that of the
king of Salem, who was Abraham’s friend, is an important fact in the
discussion. Adonizedec, the Lord of righteousness, would be a probable
successor of Melchizedec, the King of righteousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>But whilst Jerusalem was thus probably associated with two most
memorable events in the life of Abraham, it was not till the time of David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that the city rose into prominence. In his day it was regarded as an
impregnable stronghold. The Jebusites, confident in the strength of their
position, treated the attacks of the besiegers with derision, and placed upon
their walls, the blind and the lame as an adequate garrison, “thinking,
David cannot come in hither.... Nevertheless David took the stronghold
of Zion.”<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> Stung by the taunt and incited by the promise of the king, Joab
stormed the citadel and received the command-in-chief of the army as a
reward of his desperate exploit. David, who had hitherto reigned in Hebron,
now removed his capital to Jerusalem. The reasons for this are obvious.
At Hebron he was isolated from the great bulk of his subjects; Jerusalem,
though not central, was yet not very remote from the Northern tribes; it was
on the frontier of his own tribe of Judah and partly within that of Benjamin,
whose allegiance he thus secured. Military considerations were even more
decisively in favour of the new capital. Nor must we overlook the divine
guidance which thus prepared the way for the erection of the Temple on the
chosen and favoured spot. Little did the rude rough soldier, when “getting
up by the gutter and smiting the Jebusites,” think for what mighty events he
was preparing the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city fortified by David, enriched and adorned by Solomon,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a> has
continued, with varying fortunes, to occupy the same spot to the present
day. Its continuity, however, like that of the human body, is a constant
sequence of destruction and reconstruction, ever perishing yet ever renewed.
In addition to the corroding influence of time and the destructive agencies of
earthquake and fire, it has suffered yet more severely from the violence of
man. Perhaps no city in the world has undergone so many or such
disastrous sieges. Roman, Persian, Saracen, Christian, Turk, have succeeded
one another in the work of devastation. Again and again it has been laid
utterly waste, and continued for years to be desolate and forsaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of this long succession of destructive agencies is, that of
ancient Jerusalem scarcely a trace or vestige remains. The city of David
and Solomon lies buried far beneath the ruins of edifices which have
succeeded it. It is even difficult to say, with certainty, that we can find
undoubted remains above the soil of the city of Herod. The great Tyropæan
valley which divided Zion from Acra has been filled up with débris,
leaving only a slight depression. We cannot even trace the line of the
ancient walls except where they ran along the edge of the ravine, which
bounds the city on the east and south. The whole topography of Jerusalem
is hence involved in the utmost confusion. The most elementary facts as to
the localities indicated by the inspired narrative, have been for years the theme
of keen and angry dispute. Whilst the controversial literature on the subject
might fill a moderately-sized library, we seem almost as far from a satisfactory
settlement of the question as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general outline of the country and the great natural features of the
landscape are, indeed, distinct and unmistakeable. The mountains round
about Jerusalem, the valleys which encompass it, and the ridge on which it
stands, remain as they were in the days of the patriarchs and prophets and
apostles. Looked at from any of the surrounding heights, we feel no
difficulty in identifying the objects which meet our view. The scene which
lies outstretched before us from the summit of the Mount of Olives, has
been so truthfully and graphically sketched by Lady Strangford, that we
cannot do better than reproduce her description:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us sketch in slightly what we see: the bare hill to the south of
the city, with one miserable wind-worn tree on its brow, is the Hill of Evil
Counsel (where Caiaphas and the elders are said, upon no authority, however,
to have taken counsel together<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a>). It is rocky and irregular, sloping off to
the west and dying down in the Plain of Rephaim. On the north, long
ridges of low barren hills or plains, stony and bare, though dotted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>olives here and there, stretch one behind another. They seem to rise gently
from the city until the monotony is broken by the low peak of Neby
Samwil, marked by a tower, the ruin of an old convent church, since
converted into a mosque.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ridge rises slightly towards the west, and two deep narrow ravines sweep
round the holy mountain—the one is the valley of Jehoshaphat, or of the
Kedron, commencing from some distance to the north of the city, and
running along the eastern side of it to the south. The other is the Valley

and the tomb of David are seen
(the last outside the wall). These
are almost the only buildings on
which the eye can rest among the
confused mass of little brown and
white domes and grey walls: nor are
any of these seen at first, for the
Mosque of Omar, in the famous
Harâm, the second most beautiful
building in all the world, rivets all
the spectator’s attention. The wall
enclosing the mosque occupies more
than half the eastern side of the
city—in the centre of which stands
the mosque, an octagonal building,
pierced with seven windows on each
side, narrowing above into a small
circle also pierced with windows, and
surmounted by a most graceful dome,
bearing aloft the gilt crescent of
Islam; the whole building is cased
entirely in encaustic tiles—chiefly blue, green, purple, and yellow, formed
into intricate and delicate arabesques, and so mingled that it is impossible
to say whether the building is green or blue. The cornice is replaced by
an Arabic inscription in large and prettily interlaced letters. The mosque
stands on a marble platform, which is reached by broad flights of steps, and
round the edge of which are several groups of slender arches and small houses,
while little circular <i>mihrabs</i>, or praying-places, shaded by a light canopy of
fretted stone, are dotted over its surface. Round this platform are grassy slopes,
with noble cypresses and a few other trees, the bright and dark green of which
contrast beautifully with the white and coloured marbles of the buildings.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>SKETCH PLAN OF SITE OF JERUSALEM.</p>
<p class='re-caption'><i>After Robinson.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000'>It is when we endeavour to fill in the details of the city itself that our
difficulties and perplexities commence. They are caused partly by the vague
and indefinite language of ancient historians and topographers, and partly by
the fact that valleys have been filled up, hills have been levelled and
successive cities have arisen upon the ruins of those which have preceded
them, thus effacing the landmarks which would otherwise have guided us.
Mediæval and monkish traditions have likewise done much to obscure and
pervert the true topography of Jerusalem. Learning and labour have been
wasted in the endeavour to defend theories which have nothing in their
favour but ecclesiastical authority. Theological controversies have thus been
imported into questions which ought to have been discussed only in the
light of historical and geographical science.</p>

<p class='c000'>We know from Josephus that the city stood on two hills, divided by
the Tyropæan Valley. One of these was Zion, the other Acra. We read
likewise of Bezetha, Moriah, and Ophel. Did these last form a separate
ridge or were they names given to parts of one of the former? If so, to
which—Zion or Acra? The sketch plan given above shows the conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>arrived at by Dr. Robinson, who maintains that there were three separate
hills. Other writers of scarcely inferior authority identify the Temple ridge
with Zion—others again with Acra. Notwithstanding the confident dogmatism
with which each of these views has been maintained, I cannot say that
any of them have carried full conviction to my own mind. It is to be hoped
that the explorations now in
progress may throw some light
upon these obscure questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>No less conflicting are the
views as to the sites of the
<span class='sc'>Sepulchre</span> and of the <span class='sc'>Temple</span>.
Though the Temple claims
priority in the order of historical
sequence, yet, for reasons which
will subsequently appear, we
first consider the site of the
Sepulchre.</p>

<p>ENTRANCE OF CHURCH OF HOLY SEPULCHRE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The church of the Holy
Sepulchre stands in a crowded
part of the city, at some distance
to the north-west of the Temple
area. It is a comparatively
modern structure, no portion
being probably older than the
period of the Crusades. It is
entered through a courtyard, in
which a market is now held for
the sale of trinkets, rosaries,
pictures and curiosities. And
just inside the principal entrance
a Turkish guard is stationed to
keep order, and repress disturbances
amongst the hostile sects
and nationalities who visit it.</p>

<p>THE POOL OF HEZEKIAH AND THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In passing round the church,
attention is distracted and incredulity
excited by the aggregation under one roof of numerous shrines and holy
places. Here are shown not only the sites of the crucifixion and the resurrection,
but the tombs of Adam, Melchizedec, Joseph of Arimathea, and of Nicodemus;
the place where our Lord was crowned with thorns, and where He
appeared to Mary Magdalene; the pillar to which he was bound during the
scourging; the slab upon which His body was laid for the anointing; the spot
where He first appeared to His mother after the resurrection; the centre of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>world; the place whence the earth was taken from which Adam was made,
with many other marvels. Even those who come, with simple faith, to “see
the place where the Lord lay,” depart indignant at the frauds and lying
legends palmed off upon them. This feeling is increased by the tinsel and
frippery which abound everywhere. The very Chapel of the Resurrection is
made offensive by puerile ornamentation and tawdry finery. Yet in spite of
all, it is strangely affecting to see the agony of earnestness, the passionate
fervour of devotion, displayed by pilgrims, many of whom have travelled on
foot from incredible distances to pray at the sacred shrines.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may dismiss, without a moment’s hesitation, the legends which
cluster around the main central tradition; but have we reasonable ground for
believing that our Lord was crucified and buried upon this spot? What is
the evidence upon which the authenticity of the site rests?</p>

<p class='c000'>In the reign of Constantine the city had been laid utterly waste; its very
name had ceased to be used, and Christians and Jews had been banished
from it for generations. The superstitious zeal of the Empress Helena,
prompted her to visit the sacred places, and the site of Calvary had been
fixed by the alleged discovery of the three crosses which were found in a
pit, and their authenticity is said to have been attested by the miracles which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>were worked. Constantine now resolved to recover the Sepulchre and to
erect a church, the splendour and beauty of which should surpass all others.
Eusebius tells us, that the pagans had piled a mound of earth over the cave,
had paved the surface and placed upon it a temple to Venus; the emperor
caused these to be removed, when “as soon as the original surface of the
ground, beneath its covering of earth appeared, immediately and contrary to
all expectation, the venerable and hallowed monument of our Saviour’s resurrection
was discovered.” The cave was adorned with marbles, a colonnade
was erected round it, and a basilica was built in honour of the <i>Anastasis</i>, or
Resurrection.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Two questions at once suggest themselves. Did Constantine discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the true site? Does the present church stand upon the same spot with his
basilica? To these questions the most contradictory answers are given. By
some it is maintained that the emperor was guided, in his search, by accurate
information, that a continuous tradition connects his edifice with the present
church, and that, consequently, we have the very places of the entombment
and resurrection fixed beyond reasonable doubt. Others, holding that the
true site was discovered by Constantine, yet assert that during the intervals
in which Christians were banished from Jerusalem by Persian and Mohammedan
conquerors, the original edifice was destroyed, the locality forgotten,
and that a new church sprang up upon a different site, around which legends
have clustered in the lapse of ages which have no historical basis. Others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>again, assert that Constantine was the dupe either of superstition or of
imposture, and that there was absolutely no evidence that the sepulchre was
where he sought for it.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>THE PLACE OF SCOURGING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Into the protracted and angry discussions which have raged upon these
questions, I do not propose to enter here. But after a careful examination of
the site and of the arguments urged by the various disputants, I come to the
conclusion that the place of the crucifixion and entombment must be sought
elsewhere, and not on the spot which tradition points out. Though the
indications of Scripture may be insufficient to show us where it was, they are
yet quite adequate to tell us where it was not.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. It was outside the city, yet near to it (John xix. 20; Hebrews xiii. 12).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>2. It was a place where interments were permitted, and as a matter of
fact did take place (Matt. xxvii. 59, 60; Mark xv. 46, 47; Luke xxiii. 53;
John xix. 41, 42).</p>

<p class='c000'>3. There was a garden in “the place” (John xix. 41).</p>

<p class='c000'>4. It was by the side of a road leading up from the country (Matt. xxvii.
39; Mark xv. 21, 29; Luke xxiii. 26).</p>

<p class='c000'>5. It was a spot capable of being seen by a considerable number of
persons from a distance (Matt. xxvii. 55; Mark xv. 40; Luke xxiii. 49).</p>

<div id='i105'  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>CAVE UNDER THE CHURCH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>6. It was within sight and hearing of a place whence the priests could stand
without danger of defilement (Matt. xxvii. 41; Mark xv. 31; John xviii. 28).</p>

<p class='c000'>7. It was not far from the barracks of the Roman soldiers, some of
whom ran and fetched the vinegar—the ordinary <i>posca</i>, or sour drink of the
legionaries—when Jesus on the cross cried, “I thirst” (Matt. xxvii. 48;
Mark xv. 36).</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The language of the evangelists seems to imply that the procession, on
leaving the judgment hall, passed not through the city but outside it (Matt.
xxvii. 31, 32; Mark xv. 20; Luke xxiii. 26; John xix. 17).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The present site fails to satisfy any one of these conditions. It is not
only far within the walls, but apparently must have been so in the time of
our Lord when the city was much larger and more populous than now, though
in the time of Constantine, when the walls were demolished and the city
desolate, it may have been outside the inhabited district.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a> Even if by any
sudden bend, or re-entering angle the line of circumvallation left it outside,
which, however, is very unlikely, it must still have been in the midst of
houses, for we find that Agrippa, twelve years afterwards, constructed a
third line of wall to enclose an extensive suburb which had sprung up on
this side; and we know that the ceremonial law and social usages of the
Jews forbad the formation of graves among the abodes of the living.</p>

<div id='i106'  class='figcenter id022'>
<img src='images/i_106.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>VIA DOLOROSA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Where could the priests have stood who so feared<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a> defilement, that they
would not enter the judgment hall amongst a crowd of Roman soldiers and
rabble? In a place of public execution
and interment, they must have been
defiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, as seems certain, houses were all
round the present site, where could the
great multitude have watched from “afar
off?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The judgment hall and the barracks
are believed to have been in the Castle
of Antonia. In this case the Via Dolorosa
must have led, as tradition now marks it,
through the heart of the city, crowded at
the time to its utmost capacity by the
multitudes who had come up to the feast.
The rulers feared “an uproar among the
people,” many of whom “believed on
Him;” hence the need for taking Him by subtlety, and for hurrying over the
trial in an illegal and stealthy manner. Is it likely that they would run the
risk of a disturbance and a rescue in the crowded street? especially with a
guard of only four soldiers.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a> We can hardly doubt that, in accordance
with the indications of the narrative the rulers would choose some place
for the execution to which they could pass immediately from the prætorium
into the open country.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have but to transfer the scene of the crucifixion from the northern
to the eastern side of the city, in the valley of the Kedron, to find all the
requirements of the narrative satisfied. It is, and always must have been,
outside the walls. It was a recognised place of interment, the valley to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>day being full of graves, many of them very ancient and cut in the rock.
Irrigated by the river, by wells and fountains, there were numerous gardens.
The slope of Olivet would allow a great multitude to watch the scene afar
off, and the priests, standing on the Temple cloisters, would be within sight
and hail of Calvary without fear of defilement. One of the two main roads
leading from the country into Jerusalem passed close to the spot. And the
procession, leaving the prætorium, would emerge at once from the city into
the open country. Assuming then that the site of Calvary is to be sought
on the eastern side, the whole narrative becomes clear and consistent.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this be conceded a new and unexpected conformity between the type
and the great Antitype is discovered. The Epistle to the Hebrews, written at
a time when the Temple was yet standing and its sacrifices were being offered,
says, respecting the sin-offering, “the bodies of those beasts whose blood is
brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest for sin, are burned without
the camp; wherefore Jesus, also, that He might sanctify the people with His
own blood suffered without <em>the gate</em>.”<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Not merely “a gate,” but “<em>the</em> gate,”
through which the bodies of the sacrifices were carried out to be burned.
The great sin-offering for the world was thus led forth to be crucified through
the very gate and in sight of the very spot in which the typical sacrifices
had been burned in the valley of Hinnom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the rending of the veil at the moment of our Lord’s death gains a
new significance if this view be adopted. The Temple, as we know, opened to
the east. It would be within sight of Calvary. How striking, how suggestive
that the typical veil should thus be “rent in twain from the top throughout”
just when we received “boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
Jesus by a new and living way which he consecrated for us, through the veil,
that is to say, his flesh.”<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And yet further, the fact that the place of our Lord’s death, burial, and
resurrection was in close proximity to the Temple, would give additional
significance to the taunt of those “that passed by saying, Thou that destroyest
the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself.”<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a> Here again the type
and the antitype come into close juxtaposition.</p>

<p class='c004'>The site of the <span class='sc'>Temple</span> claims our next attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>In any view of Jerusalem from the eastward the vast enclosure known
as the Haram esh Sherîf, or the Noble Sanctuary, arrests the eye from its
size, its beauty, and the profound interest which attaches to it. Within its
limits stood the Temple, and the world can hardly afford a nobler, worthier
site for the house of the Lord. Standing on a ridge, guarded by valleys on
every side, it formed a natural and almost impregnable fortress. Psalmists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and prophets only gave expression to the feelings of the whole people when
they celebrated, in exulting and rapturous strains, the strength, the beauty, and
the glory of the city of God. It was a saying of the Rabbis that “the world
is like an eye. The ocean surrounding it is the white of the eye; the earth
is the coloured part; Jerusalem is the pupil; but the sanctuary is the image
within the pupil. There the being of God is at once mirrored and beheld.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of the Temple area enclose a rectangle of about fifteen
hundred feet from north to south by nine hundred feet from east to west.
Its stones are many of them of great size; Capt. Warren measured one
which was thirty-eight feet nine inches in length. The peculiar bevel which
characterises early Jewish and Phœnician work may be observed on most of
them. Occasionally, especially in the lower courses, they appear to occupy
their original position, though whether placed there by Solomon, Nehemiah, or
Herod, cannot be ascertained at present; more frequently the stones have been
replaced by later and more modern hands than those of the original builders.
A careful examination often shows that the original materials have been used
over and over again in successive walls, and commonly reduced in size so as
to be worked more easily. Columns of the finest marble, porphyry and
serpentine built in amongst the blocks of limestone, are by no means rare.
These are sometimes whole and erect, but more often broken across and laid
in horizontally with the ends projecting. They evidently formed part of the
Temple, and have been used by later builders as being ready to hand.
Examining these massive remains of ancient power and wealth it was impossible
not to remember the words of the disciples, “Master, see what
manner of stones and what buildings are here.” The stability of the edifice
seemed to be ensured not only by the size of the blocks but by the excellence
of the Jewish masonry, which was so perfect that it is often impossible to
insert the point of a knife between the joints. Yet the dilapidated condition
of the walls shows how wonderfully our Lord’s words have been verified,
“Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon
another that shall not be thrown down.”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Starting at the north-east angle, and going eastward, with the valley of
the Kedron and the Mount of Olives on our left hand, the Temple area on
our right, we come to the Golden Gate, a remarkable double gateway the date
and purpose of which are unknown. Some have supposed it to be the
Beautiful Gate at which the lame man sat begging,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a> but from the style of
architecture it can hardly be older than the age of Constantine. It is now
walled up, in consequence of a Mohammedan tradition that the Christians
will again take possession of Jerusalem, and that their King will enter
victoriously through this gate. Another tradition is that the last judgment
will take place in the valley of Jehoshaphat or of Kedron, just below us,
and that Mohammed will stand upon one of the projecting pillars over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>entrance, and Issa—their name for Jesus—on the Mount of Olives opposite,
and together judge the world.</p>

<p>THE GOLDEN GATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Along the southern side there is little to detain us. We have on our
right the wall surmounted by the roof of the mosque of El Aksa and on our
left the slope of Ophel running down to the point at which the Valleys of
Hinnom and Kedron meet. But immediately after turning the south-west
corner we come upon an object of profound interest. The Temple was on
this side divided from the city by a valley, now nearly filled up. From the
wall which here bears traces of extreme antiquity and appears to be a part
of the original structure, some huge blocks of stones are seen to project.
These were found by Robinson to form the first courses of an arch. Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Wilson, acting on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, caused a line
of shafts to be sunk due westward from this point, and discovered a series of
piers upon which other arches had rested, so that we have here the remains
of a bridge which ran across the valley connecting the Temple with the city.
We learn from Josephus that the valley was spanned by a bridge leading
from the Temple to the palace. All subsequent researches have tended to
establish the conclusion at which Robinson arrived that, “This arch could
only belong to <span class='fss'>THE BRIDGE</span>, and it proves incontestably the antiquity of that
portion of the wall from which
it springs.” The only difficulty
in the way of ascribing this great
work to Solomon or his successors
is that the principle of the
arch was not then known. A
more thorough acquaintance with
Egyptian architecture, however,
proves that this statement is not
strictly true. Examples of the
arch, though rare, may yet be
found in buildings of undoubted
antiquity. In the narrative of
the visit of the Queen of Sheba
to Solomon we read that, “When
she had seen ... his ascent by
which he went up unto the house
of the Lord, there was no more
spirit in her.”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a> This seems to be
spoken of as the climax of all
the wonders which were shown
her. If we may venture to identify
the arched bridge across the
valley with “the ascent” thus
spoken of it will adequately
explain the astonishment with which it was regarded.</p>

<p>WAILING-PLACE OF THE JEWS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A little farther along the western wall we come to the Wailing Place of
the Jews. It is close to the Jewish quarter—the foulest, most squalid and
wretched part of the city. The masonry here is the finest, and in the best
preservation, of any part of the enclosure. Many of the stones are twenty-five
feet in length and apparently have remained undisturbed since the time
of the first builder.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Here the Jews assemble every Friday to mourn over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>their fallen state, especially their exclusion from “the holy and beautiful
house,” where their fathers worshipped God. Some press their lips against
crevices in the masonry as though imploring an answer from some unseen
presence within, others utter loud cries of anguish. Here is one group joining
in the prayers of an aged rabbi; yonder another sitting in silent anguish,
their cheeks bathed in tears. The stones are in many places worn smooth
with their passionate kisses. The grief of the new-comers is evidently deep
and genuine. But with the older residents it has subsided into little more than
a mere ceremonial observance and an empty form. But in either case the
scene is strangely affecting, leading back our thoughts to the self-invoked curse
of eighteen hundred years ago—“His blood be on us, and on our children.”<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p>JEWISH ALMSHOUSES, ERECTED BY SIR MOSES MONTEFIORE, NEAR THE JAFFA GATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The northern wall has nothing to detain us, except the pool of Bethesda,
so called, but of which the identification is doubtful.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> There are still traces of
what may have been “the five porches,” but the pool is now little more than
a pit or ditch choked with filth and ordure, and, only after heavy rains,
containing a little stagnant, fetid water.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now enter the Temple area and find ourselves in an enclosure of
extraordinary beauty. In spring and early summer the turf is of a brilliant
green, enamelled with a profusion of wild flowers, and dotted over with
trees, most of them cypresses, many of which are of great size. The
birds, free from molestation, are exceedingly tame. Doves and sparrows are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>especially numerous, reminding us of the words of the psalmist, when,
“longing, yea, even fainting for the courts of the Lord,” “the sparrow hath
found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young;
even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.”<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> Cloisters,
colonnades, fountains, cupolas and shrines, are seen here and there within the
spacious area. But the eye is arrested and detained by a marble platform
from the centre of which rises one of the most exquisite domes in the world.
This is the <i>Kubbet es Sakhrah</i>, “the Dome of the Rock,” better known to
Europeans as “the <span class='sc'>Mosque of Omar</span>,” next after Mecca the most sacred,
next after Cordova the most beautiful of all moslem shrines.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a> There are
several other mosques within the Temple area, but none that claim special
notice except the one at the south end—that of El Aksa. This is a large
building, the date and original purpose of which, however, is involved in
much obscurity.</p>

<p>THE POOL OF BETHESDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The rock itself is honey-combed with excavations, most of them cisterns
or conduits. Some of these are supplied with water from Solomon’s Pools
beyond Bethlehem. The aqueduct may yet be traced along the edge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Wady Urtas. It is said that, in addition to the water brought from a
distance, there are natural springs within the rock itself; this, however, is
doubted. From whatever source the supply was derived it was so abundant
that it was never known to be exhausted. In some of these vast underground
reservoirs which I visited, I found the water to be deliciously cold,
sweet and clear. It was in reference to these inexhaustible stores from
which the priests drew so plentifully, that our Lord, “in that great day of
the feast ... stood and cried, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and
drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water. This spake He of the Spirit, which they
that believe on Him should receive.”<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the subterranean chambers is one dedicated to the Lord Issa,
or Jesus. Here according to Mohammedan
tradition he was born;
his cradle is shown, and the chapel,
for such it is, is regarded as one of
peculiar sanctity.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>SUBSTRUCTIONS UNDER THE SOUTHERN END OF THE TEMPLE AREA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Beneath the southern end of the
area is an extraordinary series of
substructions which used to be called
Solomon’s stables, and were believed
to have been erected for that purpose
by the magnificent king. Their
real design is obvious, though when
and by whom they were built cannot
be determined. The Temple
area is constructed on the summit
of Mount Moriah. As the hill sloped
downward on the east, west, and
south it was necessary to level the
top to secure a plane surface. But on the southern side or Ophel, the descent
was rapid. To have secured a level platform here, it would have been necessary
to cut away so much from the summit as seriously to have reduced its
height. These arches were, therefore, built up from beneath. The same
method was adopted at Rome to enlarge the level area of the Palatine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In what part of the extensive area thus formed did the Temple stand?
It has been commonly assumed that the marble platform in the centre marks
the site, and that the Mosque of Omar stands over the spot occupied by the
altar or the Holy Place. This view, however, is beset with doubts. The
mosque encloses a mass of rock sixty-feet in length, fifty-five in breadth, and
standing up about fifteen feet above the earth around it. Now we know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>that the Temple was built upon the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
This mass of rock, however, with its inequalities of surface could never have
been a threshing-floor. It has been said that probably the rock was cut
away around it, leaving this portion untouched. But this explanation is
equally inconsistent with the facts of the case. For the rock is unhewn, and
only in one or two places bears marks of the chisel. Besides which, if it
had stood within the precincts of the Temple it could hardly have escaped
mention, yet neither the Scriptures, the writings of Josephus, nor those of the
Talmudists allude to it.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Where could it have stood? What purpose could
it have served? Its size is fatal to the theory that it was in the most
Holy Place, which was a small chamber. It is possible, though not very
probable, that being covered with plates of brass it formed the core of the
altar of burnt-offerings. Standing on the summit and in the centre of the
ridge of Moriah, it is the likeliest place for the site of the Temple, yet the
difficulties, in the way of placing the Temple over it, are very great.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>THE TEMPLE AREA AND MOUNT OF OLIVES, FROM THE CITY WALL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another theory propounded by Mr. Fergusson, and ably supported by
Messrs. Lewin and Sandie, finds the Temple site on the south or south-west
of the Haram area. But this theory is likewise beset with great difficulties.
For the threshing-floor must then have been in a deep hollow, contrary to
the invariable practice of the Easterns, who constructed them on the tops of
hills where the wind might winnow the grain as it fell from the ears.
Besides which, the language of the psalmist and prophets implies that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Temple stood on an elevated site; they speak invariably of going up to the
house of the Lord. It is true that the southern end of the Temple area is
now on the same level with the rest, but this is secured by the vast
substructions which have been built up from the valley below; and it can
hardly be pretended that the threshing-floor of Araunah occupied this artificial
elevation; nor has any reason been suggested why, with the whole ridge of
Moriah to choose from, a site should have been selected which either buried
the Temple in a hollow, or required an amount of work below the surface
greater than that above it to bring up the platform to the necessary level.</p>

<p class='c000'>The startling theory of Mr. Fergusson as to the site of the Holy
Sepulchre demands brief notice here. He maintains that the Mosque of Omar
is the basilica of Constantine, that the mysterious rock which it encloses is
that of which the evangelist speaks, and that a cave about fifteen feet square in
the side of the rock is the very cave in which our Lord was entombed.
His argument, to which full justice cannot be done in a brief summary, may
be thus stated. He pledges his professional reputation that the Kubbet es
Sakhrah is a building of the date of Constantine, that it is not and never
could have been intended for a mosque, that it does not possess a single
characteristic of Saracenic architecture, but that in its main features it is
identical with the sepulchral basilica of Diocletian, at Spalatro, a type which
Constantine is likely to have followed. The Golden Gate he regards as the
grand entrance from the eastern side to the area of the basilica, and maintains
that it is of the same style and date with the Dome of the Rock. Assuming
the accuracy of his theory that the Temple occupied the south-western angle of
the present area, he shows that there was ample space for places of the crucifixion
and entombment to have been here without entrenching upon the Temple
precincts from which it was then separated by a deep fosse or valley, now
filled up. He then seeks to show that the indications of the Gospel narrative,
the statements of Eusebius, and the language of early pilgrims agree in fixing
upon this as the true site of the burial and resurrection of our Lord. The
absence of any tradition pointing to this spot and the fact that for nearly a
thousand years the site of the sepulchre has been supposed to be where the
church now stands, he explains by the statement that after the rock with its
dome, had been appropriated by the Mohammedans, the Christians were
banished for a long period from the city; even on their return they were not
allowed to approach the Holy Place; a new church in another site was
therefore built for the use of the pilgrims around which the legends sprang
up in mediæval fashion, so that what was at first a mere myth or pious fraud,
came at last to be accepted as an historical fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is much that is attractive in this theory, and it is supported by a
great weight of argument and learning. But it will hardly bear the test of
examination. The basilica of Constantine was not built over the sepulchre but
near it; the Kubbet es Sakhrah encloses and covers the rock. Constantine’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>building was destroyed by Chosroes II., and the church that rose upon its
site suffered the
same fate under
El-Hakem. This,
therefore, cannot
be it. Constantine
constructed a colonnade
eastward
from the church
at the end of which
was an <i>agora</i>, or
market-place. The
Kubbet es Sakhrah is so near the <a id='east'></a>eastern wall over the valley of
the Kedron that space cannot be found for this arrangement.</p>

<p>TUNNEL AND SHAFT OF THE PALESTINE EXPLORATION FUND OUTSIDE THE WALL OF THE TEMPLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whilst, therefore, the site of the sepulchre must, in my
judgment, be sought somewhere on this side of the city, I cannot
accept Mr. Fergusson’s identification as accurate or sustained by
facts. It is with reluctance that we yield ourselves to the conclusion
that accurate knowledge is, at least, for the present beyond
our reach. Most eagerly and gratefully should we welcome any
means of determining the spot so endeared by hallowed memories
and associations. But our very ignorance may have been designed
or permitted for wise purposes. A superstitious, an almost
idolatrous, worship has been fostered by pilgrimages to the holy
places. We shall do well to remember the conversation by
Jacob’s well: “The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou
art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye
say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when
ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
Father ... the hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship
the Father in
spirit and in truth:
for the Father
seeketh such to
worship Him.”<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Light may ultimately
be thrown
upon these difficult
and perplexed questions
by the labours of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Hitherto, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the obstacles thrown in their way by the Turkish government,
have been almost insuperable. It is only by extraordinary energy and
ingenuity that they have been able to accomplish anything in Jerusalem.
The sketch on the preceding page will illustrate this. Not being allowed to
excavate within a certain distance of the Temple area, a shaft was sunk
through the mass of débris, to the depth of eighty feet, just outside the
proscribed limit. A tunnel was then run from the bottom of the shaft to the
wall of the Temple. The result was the discovery of courses of masonry of
the original edifice, and upon some of the blocks of stone, mason’s marks in
ancient Phœnician characters were found.</p>

<p class='c000'>It now only remains for us to notice briefly some of the memorable
spots in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem. These, for the most
part, lie along the valley of the Kedron.</p>

<p class='c000'>First in interest is the Garden of Gethsemane. Leaving the city by
St. Stephen’s Gate, a steep path leads us down into the valley and across the
bed of the Kedron. Soon after beginning the ascent of Olivet, we come to
an enclosure about eighty yards square. Knocking at a low door, we are
admitted by an aged monk, the guardian of the place, and find ourselves in
a trim garden. The flower-beds are neatly kept and fenced with sticks. A
number of olive-trees stand among them, hollow, gnarled, and, apparently,
extremely old. They yet bear a few berries, which are carefully gathered
and given to pilgrims, for which, of course, backshish is expected in return.
Old as the trees are it cannot be supposed that they have stood here for
eighteen centuries, though it is quite credible that they may have sprung as
suckers from the roots of yet older trees. The passion for localising all the
incidents of the narrative is not absent here. We are shown the bank
upon which the disciples slept, the grotto—all mediæval legends select a grotto—where,
as a Latin inscription informs us, “the sweat like blood ran down upon
the ground,” and the place where Judas betrayed his Master with a kiss.
The <i>Custode</i> however, with a courtesy and consideration very rare in his
class, does not pester us with talk, but, retiring to a distance, leaves us
to our meditation.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a> On this spot then, or near it, happened the most solemn
and pathetic event in the life, even of “the man of sorrows.” Under the
shade of these grey olives, he endured his bitter and heart-breaking agony; along
yonder path, lighted by the full passover moon, “with lanterns, and torches,
and weapons,” came the betrayer, leading “a band of men and officers;”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
here, deserted and forsaken by all, He meekly surrendered Himself to his
murderers, and was led away to be <a id='con'></a>condemned and crucified. Callous must
that heart be which, on such a spot as this, does not breathe the prayer:
“By Thine agony and bloody sweat; by Thy cross and passion; by Thy
precious death and burial: Good Lord deliver us!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Leaving the scene of our Lord’s bitter agony, we pass along the Valley of
the Kedron, sometimes called the Valley of Jehoshaphat. Jews and Mohammedans,
alike, believe that this will be the scene of the final judgment.
Hence has arisen an eager desire to be buried here, and the soil is, in many
places, literally paved with tombstones, and the whole valley is one vast
cemetery. Shortly before reaching the point of junction of the valleys of
Hinnom and Kedron, we reach a cluster of remarkable tombs, called by the
names of Zacharias, Absalom, and St. James. The tradition respecting them
is quite modern, and has no historical basis. Those of Zacharias and
Absalom are similar in design, being cut out of the solid rock. The
former is said to be the burial-place of the Zacharias who was “slain
between the temple and the altar.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a> The latter, tradition asserts to be the
pillar which the rebellious son “reared up for himself during his lifetime in
the king’s dale, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in <a id='rem'></a>remembrance.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
Its base is now buried beneath a heap of stones, upon which
each Jew, as he passes, throws one in detestation of his memory.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The tomb of St. James is a remarkable chamber, cut out of the side of
the hill, with rock-hewn Doric columns in front. A modern tradition declares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>that here St. James retired after our Lord’s crucifixion, and vowed neither to
eat nor drink till He had risen again. On the third day the risen Saviour
appeared to him, saying, “Arise and eat, for I have now risen from the
dead.” The marked resemblance between this sepulchre and the temple-tombs
at Beni-hassan, in Egypt, has given rise to the suggestion that here we have
the idol temple constructed by Solomon for his queen, the daughter of
Pharaoh, in “the hill that is before Jerusalem.”<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a> The site and the style of
architecture afford a certain measure of probability to the conjecture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just above us on the left is Silwan, the ancient Siloam—a collection of
wretched hovels, inhabited by peasantry, who have the reputation of being
the most dangerous, turbulent, and thievish in the district. Though I have
often passed through the village alone, or with only a single companion, I
have never had anything to complain of, beyond a demand for backshish,
more than usually clamorous. In this village, and in other places round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Jerusalem, I found many of the peasantry occupying old tombs which formed
abodes at least as commodious as the huts in which their neighbours lived.
The pool of Siloam is at the foot of the hill on our right. It and the
neighbouring well of En Rogel are still much used, not only by the villagers,
but by the water sellers of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning to the right up the Valley of Hinnom, we see, on the dark and
gloomy Hill of Evil Counsel, Aceldama. Down to a very late period, it
continued to be used as “a field to bury strangers in.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Skulls brought
away from this spot and submitted to the examination of competent ethnologists,
have been pronounced to be those of negroes and other non-semitic
races.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another tomb, on the north side of the city, demands brief mention here.
It used to be called the tomb of the kings, but it has now been identified as
that of Queen Helena, a Jewish Proselyte, who in the first century of our era
died, and was buried at Jerusalem. It is remarkable not only for the extent
and perfect preservation of the sepulchral chambers, but for the ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>mechanism by which the entrance was closed or opened—a huge stone being
rolled to or from the mouth of the entrance. It thus affords an interesting
contemporary illustration of the words of the evangelists, “Who shall <em>roll</em>
away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? And when they looked
they saw the stone rolled away, for it was very great.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>But it would be impossible, with the space at our disposal, to describe,
however briefly, all the objects of interest in and around Jerusalem. Whole
volumes have been devoted to the subject without exhausting it. This brief
and inadequate sketch may be brought to a close by recalling to memory a
Sabbath morning service in Christ Church on Mount Zion, as the Protestant
church, recently erected there, is called. The liturgy had gained a deeper
significance and impressiveness from the associations of the place. The
sermon had set forth Christ crucified as the hope alike of Jew and Gentile.

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>FROM Jerusalem northward as far as Bethel,
a distance of ten or twelve miles, we pass
through the territory of Benjamin. The
topography of the district illustrates the
prophecies of Jacob and Moses as to the
destinies of this small but warlike tribe,
and explains the peculiar position which
it held in the Jewish commonwealth.
From the central plateau, which runs
north and south, a succession of rugged
and difficult passes lead east and west, debouching
on the fertile Philistine plain on
the one side, and on the yet more fertile
valley of Jericho on the other. Its
barren rocky soil, ill-adapted for agriculture,
gave birth to a race of hardy warriors, whose military prowess was often
called into exercise in protecting Jerusalem against invaders from the north, in
guarding their own mountain fastnesses, or in making forays upon the territories
of their eastern or western neighbours. Almost every hill-side has been
the scene of a battle; almost every mound of ruins marks the site of some
ancient village memorable for the heroic deeds there enacted. “Benjamin
shall ravin like a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night
he shall divide the spoil.”<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a> “And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the
Lord (<i>Jerusalem</i>) shall dwell in safety by him; and the <span class='sc'>Lord</span> shall cover him
all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders:”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> a prophecy
fulfilled when centuries afterwards the Lord took up His earthly abode among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the mountains of Benjamin. With its barren soil and numerical inferiority it
yet won for itself the proud title of “little Benjamin their ruler;”<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a> it gave the
first king to Israel, and the great Apostle of the Gentiles boasted, with a lawful

<p>JERUSALEM AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES FROM SCOPUS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For some miles along the road, or from the eminences which skirt it,
Jerusalem is visible. Age after age, invading armies, or bands of pilgrims,
approaching from the north, as they have turned the crest of Scopus, have
gained their first view of the city—a view in some respects even finer than
that from Olivet. Here the first crusaders halted at break of day, and as
Jerusalem burst upon their view, they knelt, and with tears of gladness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>kissed the sacred soil. Richard Cœur de Lion, leaving his camp at Ajalon,
pressed forward alone, and as he ascended one of these hills, buried his face
in his mailed hands, and exclaimed, “Oh! Lord God, I pray Thee that I may
never look upon Thy holy city, if so be that I rescue it not from Thine enemies.”</p>

<p>RAMAH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A complete itinerary of the villages along this route is given us by the
prophet Isaiah, describing the march of the Assyrian army. Beginning at Ai,
near Bethel, about twelve miles north of Jerusalem, “he is passed to Migron,
at Michmash he hath laid up his baggage; they are gone over the passage;
they have taken up their lodging (<i>i.e.</i> halted for the night), at Geba; Ramah
is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim:
cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth. Madmenah is removed;
the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee. As yet shall he remain at
Nob that day.” Having thus seized all the villages on his line of march, he
has reached the immediate precincts of the city, where the camp of the
Assyrians is yet pointed out. Confident of victory, “he shall shake his hand
against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem;” but “the
Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror, and the high ones
of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.”<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly all the villages here enumerated can be <a id='id'></a>identified, and not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>few of them still bear their ancient names. A Concordance or a reference-Bible
will show what an affluence of historical associations lie all around us—Ai,
the scene of Joshua’s first great battle—Migron, where the army of
Saul encamped in his campaign against the Philistines—Michmash, the scene
of Jonathan’s heroic exploit—Ramah, the home of Samuel—Gibeah, the
birth-place of Saul—Gallim and Laish the abode of Phalti the husband of
Michal, when torn away from David—Anathoth, the residence of Jeremiah,
and Nob where in the house of Ahimelech the priest, the sword of Goliath
was laid up, and the shew-bread was placed before the Lord, of which David
“did eat when he was a hungred, and they that were with him.”</p>

<p>ANATHOTH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Apart from its historical associations, there is little to interest in the
district through which we pass. A bleak, wind-swept, rock-strewn moor or
a series of rounded hills where the grey limestone comes up to the surface,
with only a few patches of meagre vegetation on the shallow soil, make up
the scene. There is, however, one steep conical hill rising above the others,
which arrests attention. Like the Jebel Fureidis near Bethlehem, it is
conspicuous from every direction. Its modern name Neby Samwil—<span class='sc'>The
Tomb of Samuel</span>—embalms the memory of the prophet, who here judged
Israel. With very strong probability it is identified with Mizpeh, <i>i.e.</i> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Watch-tower, a name exactly appropriate to this lofty eminence, from which
a view is gained over the whole of Southern Palestine. Here the prophet
summoned Israel to war against their oppressors, or convened them for
judgment; here “he took a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
and called the name of it <i>Eben-ezer</i>, saying, Hitherto, hath the Lord helped
us;” and here was heard, for the first time, the cry of devout loyalty, so
often repeated since, “God save the king.”<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>About two hours after leaving Jerusalem, we reach a small town, Bireh,
the Beeroth of the Gibeonites,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a> but which has a deeper interest from its
connection with the life of our Lord. It was the first stage for the pilgrims
returning northward from Jerusalem, where they halted for the night. The
stragglers who had lingered in the city here rejoined their companions and
resumed their journey to Galilee on the following morning. The Child
Jesus having tarried behind in Jerusalem, “Joseph and His mother knew not
of it; but they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day’s
journey; and they sought Him amongst their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And
when they found Him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking Him.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A little to the north-west of Beeroth, we approach an Arab village,
standing on the ridge of a hill with a valley on either side. To the eastward
the ridge rises considerably, giving an extensive view over the Jordan valley.
A desolate moorland, strewn with ruins, stretches away to the north. As we
enter the village, the first of the wretched and squalid houses which comprise
it, makes some pretension to architectural decorations in a form not uncommon
through central Palestine—over the doorway a couple of willow-pattern plates
are let into the wall. The modern name, Beitîn, is but a reminiscence of its
ancient and venerable one <span class='sc'>Bethel</span>. But except the name there is little to
remind us that we are on a spot so memorable in Jewish history. A large
reservoir, similar to those at Solomon’s Pools and Hebron,—three hundred and
fourteen feet long by two hundred and seventeen wide, constructed of massive
Jewish masonry, may not improbably go back to a very early period. It is
now empty except after heavy rains; but it was formerly filled by the
springs at which Abram doubtless watered his flocks and herds when,
entering the land of Canaan, “he pitched his tent, having Bethel on the
west, and Hai on the east, and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and
called upon the name of the Lord.”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The patriarch after his journey into Egypt, returned “unto the place
where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai unto the
place of the altar which he had made there at the first, and there Abram
called upon the name of the Lord,” for wherever he pitched his tent there
he built an altar—an example to all future ages of household piety and
domestic worship. It was here and now that the strife occurred between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>his herdsmen and those of his nephew Lot. Standing on the high ground
already spoken of, the younger man “lifted up his eyes and beheld all the
plain of the Jordan that it was well watered everywhere ... even as the
garden of the Lord ... then Lot chose him all the plain of the Jordan,
and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the
other.” As one contrasts the barren rocky hills around us with the rich and
fertile plain of Sodom, the self-denial of “the Father of the faithful,” becomes
very striking and instructive. A new meaning is thus given to the promise
which followed upon the choice of Abram: “And the Lord said unto him,
after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up thine eyes, and look from
the place where thou now art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and
westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy
seed for ever.... Arise, walk through the land, in the length of it and
in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.”<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a> The blessing which thus
came upon “faithful Abraham,” will surely be inherited by all who, like him,
are content to forego present advantages in the service and at the call of God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the city which once stood upon this site scarcely any trace remains.
A careful examination of the ruins of a Christian church, probably of the date
of the Crusades, shows that it has been built out of an older edifice. The
size of many of the stones and the peculiar bevel on the edge shows that
the original edifice was Jewish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foundations of other ancient structures may be traced on the hill-side,
and near its summit are the remains of a tower which still rises to a considerable
height. Nothing has yet been discovered to fix the site of the
temple which Jeroboam built here to rival that at Jerusalem, or of the altar
where, as he stood to offer incense, he was rebuked by the fearless prophet,
followed by the withering of the monarch’s arm, and the miraculous overthrow
of the altar.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a> A Jewish tradition tells us that the temple was so built that the
idol-priests could look down upon that of Solomon on Mount Moriah. From
the top of the tower this cannot now be done, but the Mount of Olives is
distinctly visible almost to its base. Jerusalem is hidden by an intervening hill.
I was told by my dragoman that a few years ago, before the upper courses of
masonry had been removed, the temple platform could be seen, and it was
evident that a very small addition to the height at which I stood would
render this quite practicable.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was somewhere in the rock-strewn moorland, which stretches around
the city, that Jacob, travelling northward, a fugitive from his father’s house
at Beersheba, received the mysterious vision, which formed the turning point
in his career. Standing amongst these heaps of stones and sheets of smooth,
bare rock, it is easy to realize the scene as “he tarried there all night
because the sun was set, and he took of the stones of the place and put them
for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.”<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p>STONE CIRCLE NEAR BETHEL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The historian goes on to tell us that “the name of that city was called
Luz at the first,” implying an earlier Canaanitish settlement. A curious and
interesting trace of this fact is found in the stone-circles, resembling those in
our own country, which still exist on the east of the city. There are
numerous instances in Palestine of the occurrence of dolmens and rude stone
circles. We must doubtless refer them to the early settlers, antecedent to the
Hebrew conquest.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now leave the sterile rocky heights of Benjamin and Judah, and
shall soon enter upon the fertile plains and valleys of Samaria. The soil is
richer and better cultivated. The hills are terraced up to their summits,
and are covered with corn-fields and orchards. In the days of prosperity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>plenty, when “every man sat under his own vine and fig-tree,” even the
barren slopes of Southern Palestine were brought under cultivation. They
drew “honey from the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.” Even yet we
can trace the lines of these ancient terraces showing what the land once was,
and what it may yet become again when “the time to favour Zion, yea, the
set time, is come.” But now these long lines or scattered heaps of stones
only add to the general sense of desolation. In the country north of Bethel,
however, we come to many districts in which something of the former fertility
and prosperity may yet be found. From our camp in Ain Haramiyeh, or
Robbers’ Fountain, a few miles north of Bethel, we could see the hills clothed
to their very summits with fig-gardens, now in their bright spring greenery.
A Syrian gentleman, who was my frequent companion through this part of
Palestine, plucked the young figs as he passed without stint or scruple. His
reply to my question as to his right to do so was instructive as throwing light
upon an incident in the life of our Lord as to which some difficulty has been
felt. In the early spring, when the first leaves appear, an immense number of
small figs are produced, which do not ripen but fall from the branches, crude
and immature, to the ground. To these we find a reference in the Apocalypse
“as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs.”<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a> The true crop is not produced till
later in the year. This first crude “untimely” growth, though of no commercial
value, is yet plucked and eaten by the peasantry, sometimes with a pinch of salt,
sometimes with bread. Like the wild fruit of our hedgerows it is free to all
passers-by. It was just at this early season, before the feast of the passover,
that our Lord and His disciples, having walked from Bethany, “hungered.”
Seeing a fig-tree “afar off having leaves,” they sought fruit and “found nothing
thereon but leaves only, for the time of figs was not yet.”<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a> That is to say, seeing
leaves they had a right to expect fruit. Finding fruit they would have had
a right to pluck it, “for the time of figs was not yet,” the true and valuable
crop was not yet produced. This incident He turned into a solemn lesson of
warning to the Jews. It was at the close of His public ministry. “Behold,
these three years I come seeking fruit and finding none,”<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a>—nothing but the
leaves of mere profession and outward privilege. The time of forbearance and
patient pitying delay had passed—that of rejection and destruction had come;
“and He said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.
And presently the fig-tree withered away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth
up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah,”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> stood <span class='sc'>Shiloh</span>,
exactly on the spot thus precisely indicated is the village of Seilûn, the Arabic
form of its ancient name. It stands on a slight eminence, rising from an
extensive plain. An ancient well probably marks the spot where “the
daughters of Shiloh came out to dance in dances” at their annual festival,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and were carried away as brides by the Benjamites who had crossed the
frontier.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a> Of the tabernacle in which the ark rested, from the time of Joshua
to that of Samuel, no trace, of course, remains. But on the summit of a little
knoll we find the remains of what was once a Jewish synagogue, afterwards
used as a church, and subsequently as a mosque. On the lintel over the
doorway, between two wreaths of flowers, is carved a vessel shaped like a
Roman amphora; it so closely resembles the conventional type of the “pot
of manna” as found on coins and in the ruins of the synagogue at Capernaum,
that it doubtless formed part of the original building. It is a not improbable
conjecture that the synagogue may have been erected on the sacred
spot which for so many generations formed the centre of Jewish worship.
And in the rock sepulchres with which the neighbouring hill-sides are honey-combed,
the remains of Eli, and of the high-priests who had ministered
before him at the altar were doubtless laid to rest.</p>

<p>RUINS OF A SYNAGOGUE AT SHILOH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There are few spots in Palestine of which the identification is more certain,
or the associations more interesting than Shiloh. Here the childless wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>prayed; and when her prayer had been heard she brought the infant Samuel
(<i>Asked of the Lord</i>), and said to the aged priest, “Oh my lord, as thy soul
liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the
Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition
which I asked of Him: therefore also I have lent him to the Lord: as long
as he liveth shall he be lent to the Lord.” The incidents which followed—the
annual visit of the happy mother, the little coat, made with such loving
care, for the absent boy, the child Samuel “growing in stature and in favour
both with the Lord and also with men,” the aged, sorrowful priest, the
mysterious voice in the silence of the night, the mournful tragedy of Eli’s
death, and the universal recognition of “all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba
that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord,”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a>—have

<p class='c000'>The subsequent history of this favoured spot is very mournful. Partaking
in the wickedness and idolatry of Samaria, and then deserted by the
apostate people for more favoured shrines, it soon sank down into ruin and
desolation, so that in the time of the later kings it became a conspicuous
instance of the fate which awaits all who forsake God. God “forsook the
tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He placed among men.” “But go ye now
unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and
see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.” “I will make
this house (the Temple) like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the
nations of the earth.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a> The same lesson is thus taught us here as in the cities

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>SHORTLY after leaving Seilûn we descend

bound the view on the north-west. Rising

<p>THE VALLEY OF SHECHEM, WITH EBAL AND GERIZIM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The circumstances of our Lord’s memorable visit are stated with great
precision. It was
on his way from
Judæa into Galilee,
in the early spring—“there
are yet
four months, and
then cometh harvest”—at
the hour
of noon—“Jesus being
wearied with his
journey sat thus on
the well, and it was
about the sixth
hour.” At the same
season, by the same
route, at the same
hour, we reached the
well. Early in the
year though it was, we found the heat very great and the journey toilsome.
Thankful indeed were we to arrive at the resting-place. The fields were
bright with the tender green of spring-time. The wide expanse of pasture
and the patches of young corn were inexpressibly refreshing to the eye
after our long sojourn among the barren hills of the south. In due time
“the sower and the reaper would rejoice together.” But alas! the spiritual
harvest which had seemed ready to the reaper’s hand as our Lord spoke,
has issued only in disappointing failure. The divine Husbandman himself
gathered in the first fruits; those that followed found “tares” only. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>bitter animosity with which the Samaritans regarded the Jews was soon
turned against the Christians. Even when the empire had become nominally
Christian, violent and murderous persecutions broke out against the followers
of Him who had here proclaimed Himself the Messiah, “I, that speak unto
thee, am He.” And as though inheriting the fanatical hostility of their
ancestors, the present Moslem population of Nablus, are amongst the most
bigoted and violent in the whole East.</p>

<p>JACOB’S WELL AND JOSEPH’S TOMB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The well is still “deep,” though the bottom is choked with rubbish and
the stones cast into it by travellers. The measurements, however, vary
considerably. Maundrell, and Robinson in his first edition, make the depth
one hundred and five feet; McCheyne, Wilson, and Calhoun only seventy-five.
The careful and repeated soundings of my own party nearly coincide
with the latter statement; we made it seventy-eight feet. I can suggest no
way of reconciling these discrepancies. It is probable that the depth may have
diminished since the visit of Maundrell in 1697. Robinson does not appear to
have measured it himself, but to have relied upon the report of his companions.
The upper part of the shaft is lined with rough masonry. After copious rains
there is a little water in the bottom, but ordinarily the well is quite dry.</p>

<p>NABLUS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A few hundred feet north of Jacob’s well, in the same “parcel of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>ground,” is Joseph’s tomb. The structure over it is modern, and is an
ordinary Mohammedan <i>wely</i>. There is, however, no reason to doubt the
authenticity of the tradition which fixes upon this as the sepulchre of the
patriarch. The deep alluvial soil would not allow of the interment being in
a rock-hewn grave; but if the coffin were of granite or alabaster, like those
of Egyptian magnates, it might yet be recovered if excavation were permitted.
We have, however, already seen, when speaking of the cave of Machpelah,
that the Mohammedans assert that the body was removed from its original
place of sepulture and placed with those of the other patriarchs at Hebron.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>The valley leading up to <span class='sc'>Nablus</span>, the Neapolis of the Romans, the
Sychar or Shechem of the Jews, is one of rare beauty. Dr. Porter says,
with slight exaggeration, “it is the finest in Palestine—in fact, it is the only
really beautiful site from Dan to Beersheba.” Without the grandeur of
the snow-crowned peaks of Switzerland, it yet reminded me of the Swiss-Italian
valleys in its bright colour and rich vegetation. Van de Velde’s description
of it is graphic and truthful: “Here there is no wilderness, here there are
no wild thickets, yet there is always verdure; always shade, not of the oak,
the terebinth, and the carob-tree, but of the olive grove—so soft in colour,
so picturesque in form, that for its sake we can willingly dispense with all
other wood. Here there are no impetuous mountain-torrents, yet there is
water; water, too, in more copious supplies than anywhere else in the land;
and it is just to its many fountains, rills and water courses that the valley
owes its exquisite beauty.... There is a singularity about the Vale of
Shechem, and that is the peculiar colouring which objects assume in it. You
know that wherever there is water, the air becomes charged with watery
particles; and that distant objects beheld through that medium seem to be
enveloped in a pale blue or grey mist, such as contributes not a little to
give a charm to the landscape. But it is precisely these atmospheric tints
that we miss so much in Palestine. Fiery tints are to be seen both in the
morning and the evening, and glittering violet or purple-coloured hues where
the light falls next to the long deep shadows; but there is an absence of
colouring, and of that charming dusky haze in which objects assume such
softly blended forms, and in which also the transition in colour from the
foreground to the farthest distance loses the hardness of outline peculiar to
the perfect transparency of an eastern sky. It is otherwise in the Vale of
Shechem, at least in the morning and the evening. Here the exhalations
remain hovering among the branches and leaves of the olive-trees, and hence
that lovely bluish haze. The valley is far from broad, not exceeding in some
places a few hundred feet. This you find generally enclosed on all sides;
there likewise the vapours are condensed. And so you advance under the shade
of the foliage along the living waters, and charmed by the melody of a host of
singing birds—for they, too, know where to find their best quarters—while the
perspective fades away, and is lost in the damp vapoury atmosphere.”<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To enjoy this lovely scenery in its full perfection, we must spend the
evening hours on one of the flat roofs of the city. One such evening I shall
never forget. Ebal and Gerizim were glowing in the light of the setting
sun. The long stretch of orchards and gardens along the valley were already
dim in the purple shadows. The noise from the crowded streets died away.
The stars began to peep out. The landscape faded from view. Our evening
hymn of praise ascended to the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who
“sendeth darkness and it is night.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>The abundance of water to which Van de Velde refers raises the
question why Jacob should have dug a well so deep, with so much cost and
labour, when the natural springs of the valley would have sufficed him?
Why, too, should the Samaritan woman have come hither from the city,
nearly two miles distant, to draw water, when she must have passed
numerous fountains by the way? The reply to the first question is, that
throughout the East water is jealously guarded by the inhabitants, who resent
the intrusion of strangers upon their rights. In the book of Genesis, as
amongst the fellahin and bedouin of to-day, we find no case of contention as
to pasturage, but numerous instances of feuds arising out of the use of wells
and fountains. And, as Dean Stanley remarks, we have here an illustration
of the characteristic prudence and caution of Jacob, who carefully avoided all
causes of quarrel with the tribes amongst whom he had settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reply to the second question is probably to be found in the fact
that there are indications that the ancient city extended farther to the
eastward and nearer to the well than the present. There may, too, have
been reasons for preferring the water drawn from hence. Its superior quality—orientals
are epicures in this respect—or the hallowed associations connected
with the well may have prompted the Samaritans to fetch it from a distance,
though there were fountains close at hand.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Doubts and difficulties have often been expressed as to the possibility of
the law being read on the opposite mountains of Ebal and Gerizim whilst
the people were encamped between them. It has been said that at so great
a distance the voices must have been inaudible. Some commentators have
felt this so strongly that they have sought for an Ebal and Gerizim elsewhere.
Infidels have made merry over the assumed incredibility of the narrative.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a>
But no real difficulty exists. Just where the valley begins to narrow a deep
depression indents the sides of the opposing mountains, up which at the
height of a few hundred feet two level <i>plateaux</i> confront each other. At this
spot, which seems as though it had been created for the very purpose, the
reading of the law probably took place, the priests standing on the plateau
on either side, the people in the plain below. We tried the experiment
under the most unfavourable circumstances. A very high wind was blowing
down the valley, carrying the sounds away from us. Neither of the readers
had powerful voices. And yet not only could we who remained in the
valley hear them, but they heard one another with sufficient distinctness
to read alternate verses, each beginning where the other left off. Had the
day been calm or the readers possessed voices of greater power, every word
would have been distinctly audible. This is due partly to the conformation
of the hill sides forming, as it were, a double amphitheatre, partly to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>elastic quality of the dry atmosphere of Syria which conveys sound to an
amazing distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The side of Ebal, the mountain of the cursing, is barren and rocky as
compared with that of Gerizim, the mountain of the blessing. The latter is
clothed with abundant pasturage to the very summit. The ascent is steep
and difficult, but it well repays the labour, even if it were for the view alone.
Nearly the whole extent of Palestine is visible—the hills of Galilee, the
mountains of Benjamin and Judah, the Mediterranean and the great Philistine
plain, the valley of the Jordan, the plains of Bashan and the mountains of Moab.
Hermon is just hidden by an intervening height. The Samaritans assert,
and many modern scholars maintain, that here, and not on the southern
Moriah, Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac. A more imposing site could
hardly be found, and reading the narrative on the spot the imagination is
strongly enlisted in favour of the opinion which has found so able a defender
in Dean Stanley.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>RUINS ON THE SUMMIT OF GERIZIM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But that which invests the summit of Gerizim with an interest absolutely
unique, is the fact that here, and here alone, the feast of the Passover is
still celebrated in accordance with the Mosaic ritual. The Jews for eighteen
centuries have been unable to observe their great national festival. The
Samaritans have never ceased to do so. I should gladly have been present
at this interesting ceremony, but as it wanted three weeks to the full
moon of the month Nisan, I was unable to remain. I received, however,
a minute description of the ceremony from a native of Nablus who has often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>witnessed it, and Yacoub, the high priest, gave me much information on
the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the ruins of their ancient Temple and, as they allege, close to the
spot where Abraham offered Isaac, and Joshua placed the stones inscribed with
the words of the law from Gilgal, two pits have been dug, and a long
trench formed and lined with stones. Early in the morning of the day the
officials commence their preparations. Fuel is gathered and a large fire
kindled in each of the pits, prayers being recited the whole time. Over one
of the pits two large cauldrons are placed and filled with water. In the
afternoon, the lambs five or six in number, are driven to the spot. The
narrative of the institution of the Passover is now chanted in a high key, the
women who stand round joining in with shrill excited cries. At a signal
from the priest the lambs are thrown across the trench, and, in an instant, a
keen long knife is drawn twice across the throat of each, nearly severing the
head from the body. When the blood has been thoroughly drained from the
carcase it is either dipped into the cauldron or the boiling water is poured
over it to enable the <i>shochetim</i> to strip off the wool without difficulty. The
entrails having been taken out and burnt, the portions allotted to the priests
removed and salt added, the bodies are placed upon spits made, it is said, of
pomegranate wood. A transverse bar is affixed to one end of the spit to
prevent the body slipping. This forms a rude cross. Justin Martyr, a native
of Nablus, writing in the second century, says that the fore-legs were
fastened to the cross-bar. Though this is no longer done, there is no reason
to doubt the accuracy of his statement, nor can we wonder that he saw in
it a type of the crucifixion of the true Paschal Lamb. The bodies are now
placed amongst the hot ashes of the oven prepared for the purpose. A
hurdle is placed over it and covered with earth so as to retain the heat. In
about three hours the earth is removed, the hurdle torn off and the lambs
drawn out amidst the wild excited cries of the people. During the early
part of the ceremony they had stood barefooted in acknowledgment of the
sanctity of the place, but now having resumed their shoes, tied girdles of
rope round their waists and taken staves in their hands, they proceed eagerly
and hastily to tear off and eat portions from the bodies, over which bitter
herbs have been sprinkled. In an incredibly short time the whole has been
consumed excepting the bones. These are then collected and with every
fragment that can be found, after the most diligent search, are thrown into
the fire to be consumed. The ceremony concludes soon after midnight. It
was described to me as strangely impressive. The wild cries of the
worshippers, the glare of the fires, the mountain top and the surrounding
landscape lit up by the light of the full moon, the solemn associations of
the rite and the place, must together make up a scene of intense interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Samaritans—“the smallest and the oldest sect in the world”—are
now reduced to one hundred and twenty persons, all of whom reside in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Nablus. The aged priest Amram, mentioned favourably by Wilson, Dean
Stanley, and Mills, has lately been deposed from his office in consequence of
an intrigue conducted by his nephew and successor, Yacoub. The latter
looks about thirty years of age, though he is probably older. He has
remarkably handsome and finely-chiselled features, but with a sinister, unpleasant
expression. He professes to be able to trace his pedigree in an
unbroken line from Aaron. The account he gives of his ancestry is that,
down to the time of Nehemiah the high priesthood continued in one unbroken
line, but that then one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the high
priest, having married the daughter of Sanballat, the governor of Samaria,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
refused to put her away when required to do so. Hereupon a schism took
place, and from this point his genealogy follows a different line to that of
the high priest of Jerusalem. He said that a genealogical table, laid up
with the copies of the law in the Holy Place of the synagogue, gave all the
generations of this pedigree, and that it recorded the most memorable events
that happened in the period of each high priest. He declared that amongst
these memorabilia was one recording that “a prophet named Jesus had
appeared at Jerusalem, but that the priests there, with their usual wickedness
and malignity, had put him to death out of envy.” If such a contemporary
record does indeed exist, it would be a document of extraordinary interest
and value. He adhered to his statement, notwithstanding my strongly-expressed
incredulity, and promised to send me extracts from the original
roll. These, however, I have not received. The character for untruthfulness
which the Samaritans bear excites suspicion, but it is difficult to see what he
could hope to gain by deceiving me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The synagogue of the Samaritans is a small secluded edifice, entered
through a walled garden, out of which an enclosed court conducts into the
building itself. It is only thirty-seven feet and a few inches in length, and
perhaps twenty feet in breadth; the walls are whitewashed and the floor
covered with matting. A place is railed off for the Holy Place, in a recess of
which the volumes of the law are kept. We were of course anxious to see
the famous copy of the Pentateuch, declared to have been written by
“Abishua, the great grandson of Aaron, at the door of the Tabernacle in
the thirteenth year of the settlement of the children of Israel” in the Holy
Land. Though this is recorded in the body of the manuscript itself, the
statement is discredited, and the most contradictory opinions are entertained
amongst scholars as to its actual date, some ascribing to it a venerable
antiquity, and others insisting that it is comparatively modern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having taken off our shoes at the entrance, Yacoub locked the door, so
that none of his co-religionists might enter, and took out from the recess a
roll of the law, which he declared to be the one we desired to see. According
to his usual custom, however, he was endeavouring to palm off upon us a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>duplicate instead of the original. He persisted to the last in the assertion that
this duplicate was the copy shown to the Prince of Wales and his party in 1853,
and there seems reason to believe that this was really the case. The fraud
being detected, he, after much hesitation and a promise of liberal backshish,
produced the genuine manuscript. It is wrapped in a cover of red satin
embroidered with gold, and enclosed in a cylinder of silver, which opens on
hinges.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION OF THE INSCRIPTIONS ON THE COVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Mills, who resided three months in Nablus in order to acquaint
himself thoroughly with the Samaritans, says of it: “The roll itself is of
what we should call parchment, but of a material much older than that,
written in columns twelve inches deep and seven and a half inches wide.
The writing is in a fair hand, but not nearly so large or beautiful as the
book-copies which I had previously examined. The writing being rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>small, each column contains from seventy to seventy-two lines. The name of
the scribe is written in a kind of acrostic, and forms part of the text, running
through three columns, and is found in the Book of Deuteronomy. Whether
it be the real work of the great grandson of Aaron, as indicated in the
writing, I leave the reader to judge; the roll, at all events, has all the appearance
of a very high antiquity, and wonderfully well preserved, considering
its venerable age.”</p>

<p>TWO PAGES OF A BOOK COPY OF THE SAMARITAN PENTATEUCH.<br /><span class='sc'>From a Photograph taken for the “Palestine Exploration Fund.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One of the halves of the metal cylinder is very curious, and deserves more
attention than it has received at the hands of Biblical archæologists. It is of
silver, about two feet six inches long, by ten or twelve inches in diameter, and is
covered with embossed work with a descriptive legend attached to each portion.
I procured a rubbing from Yacoub, and on my return to England found that it
had been photographed by the Palestine Exploration Fund. Yacoub said that
it was a plan of the Temple and its furniture; on examination, however, it
proves to be the Tabernacle of the Wilderness. Mr. Van Straalen, successor
to Mr. Deutsch at the British Museum, has been good enough to examine
it for me, and reports that the letters are Samaritan, not later than the
fourth century, and probably older. Some of the lettering he has been
unable to decipher. The annexed engravings show the cylinder and a
translation of the inscriptions, so far as they are yet read.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the outer rim are a series of numbers running from one to sixty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>These probably refer to the posts, which appear to have been numbered so
as to avoid confusion and delay in the erection of the Tabernacle on its
arrival at the camping-ground. The instructions given to Moses “in the
Mount,” were, that there should be twenty boards on each side, but at the
corners were to be two boards additional. At the end, behind the most holy
place, were to be six boards. Nothing is said about the entrance, which
apparently was to be left open.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a> Posts, however, would be needed to sustain
the framework with its covering. This would give 24 + 24 + 6 + 6 = 60,
the numbers shown in the plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>We then find the names of the twelve tribes. These are given not
according to patriarchal seniority or tribal precedence, but in the order of the
encampment and march, as recorded in the Book of Numbers. Judah, Issachar,
and Zebulon are on one side. These tribes formed the vanguard of the
army, and were followed on the march by the Tabernacle itself. Then came
Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. As soon as they “set forward” they were
followed by the ark, which was thus in the midst of the people whether
marching or camping. Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin come next; then
Dan, Asher, and Naphtali bring up the rear.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the Holiest of Holies we find the ark, with its crown or rim of
beaten gold, upon which are the cherubim kneeling face to face, whilst their
wings projecting behind them overshadow the mercy-seat.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> On one side of
the ark is the staff of Moses, on the other that of Aaron. The veil hangs
down in front concealing the mysterious recess. Immediately in front of the
veil are the stations of the Levites. The altar of incense comes next, and
then the table of shewbread with the candlestick “over against the table, on
the side of the tabernacle, southward.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> The spoons, bowls, and covers are
marked in the place indicated by Moses near the table.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The entrance from
the outer court was, as the Talmud describes it, not in the centre, but on
the right-hand side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The laver stands at “the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation,”
that the priests might wash as they entered into the holy place.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Near it is
the altar of burnt offering, with its “brazen grate of network of brass.”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
This grating or network has been the subject of much controversy amongst
Biblical critics. The representation here given, favours the view of those who
suppose it to have been an inclined plane leading up to the altar. The
censer is placed immediately over against the altar of burnt offering, that the
priests might take the coals from the sacrifice, and therewith offer the incense
of thanksgiving.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The flesh-hooks, forks, knives, pans, and basins, are
represented as arranged around the altar.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a> The trumpets at the entrance are
peculiar in form, and may throw some light upon a question much debated
amongst students of the Talmud as to the shape of one which appears to

curious relic are as yet doubtful. Subsequent investigations may throw light
upon its origin.</p>

<p>IN A BAZAAR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The few survivors of the Samaritans are now rent asunder by intestine
feuds. Apparently, they will speedily cease to exist altogether. Their
synagogue rolls may then come into the hands of Europeans, and receive a
more careful and thorough examination than has been hitherto possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Nablus alone of all the cities of Palestine is it possible to see and
feel what “the good land” was in the days of its prosperity. In addition
to the fertility of its soil and the beauty of its situation, there is an air of
activity and life which is wanting elsewhere. Lying on the main road between
the interior and the coast it has a considerable traffic. Its bazaars are
crowded with bedouin from beyond the Jordan, with the peasantry of the
valley, and with Russian, Armenian and Greek pilgrims who, having landed
at Haifa, are on their way to Jerusalem. The wrangling and chaffering
between the buyers and sellers belonging to these various nationalities offer a
curious contrast to the quiet modes of transacting business at home. The
shopkeeper begins by asking four times as much as he means to take. The
customer meets him by bidding a fourth of what he means to give. Bystanders
join in the negotiation. The whole party work themselves up into what appears
to be a fit of uncontrollable fury, shrieking and yelling at one another in
their guttural Arabic till manslaughter seems imminent. At length the bargain
is concluded, and peace is restored.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nablus boasts of some manufactures. Considerable quantities of soap
are made, and one large factory has quite a European look. The oil produced

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>A CHARMING ride of about six miles north-west
from Nablus brings us to Samaria.
The road follows the valley for some
distance, and then mounts the western
shoulder of Ebal. As we reach the
crest of the ridge, a beautiful and fertile
plain, surrounded by hills, bursts upon
us. In the centre of the basin rises a
flat-topped hill, its sides terraced to the
summit, on which stand the remains of
the ancient city. Rows of columns are
seen clear and sharp against the skyline,
and amongst the mean houses
of the peasantry stand the ruins of the
magnificent city built here by Herod,
and called by him Sebaste (= Augusta) in honour of his imperial patron.</p>

<p>RUINED CHURCH OF ST. JOHN IN SAMARIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The great and obvious advantages of the site of Samaria make it
extraordinary that a city did not exist here at a very early period. The
Biblical narrative, however, is clear, that it was built by Omri, the father of
Ahab, who bought the hill from Shemer for two talents of silver, and
built on it a city which he called Samaria, after the name of the former
proprietor.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Shechem, the earlier capital, lying in a valley, was exposed to
attack. Samaria seated on a hill could be easily defended, and was more
central. The seat of government was, therefore, removed thither, and gave
its name to the northern confederacy. The strength of its position is proved
by the fact that it sustained two severe sieges from the Syrians who
attacked it with “all their hosts.”<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a> On the first occasion Benhadad, brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>against it “thirty-two kings,” his allies. On the second, it held out till the
last horrors of famine had been endured. In both cases the city finally
escaped by divine intervention; but it must have been almost impregnable to
have held out against such formidable attacks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Climbing the rather steep ascent that leads up into the city, we come to
a large pool or reservoir. Though it does not possess the same marks of
antiquity as those at Hebron, Urtas and Bethel, it has yet been identified
with some probability as that near which Naboth was slain by the infamous
and idolatrous Jezebel, and where shortly after, “one washed the chariot of
Ahab in the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and they
washed his armour according to the word of the Lord, which he spake.”<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Near “the pool of Samaria” are the remains of a large and handsome
Christian Church, in the cave under which, according to a very early tradition,
the body of John the Baptist was buried after his execution.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a> Though the
date of the edifice is comparatively modern, it leads back our thoughts to
Apostolic times, when “Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
Christ unto them, and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
which he spake.” Such was the success of his ministry that Peter and John
joined him in the work. Here it was that the divine judgment fell upon Simon
the Sorcerer—a solemn warning to after ages of the danger of mercenary
motives in religious profession.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the earlier city of Omri and Ahab no trace remains. The threatenings
of ancient prophecy have been literally fulfilled. “I will make Samaria as a
heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the
stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.”
“Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious
beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them
that are overcome with wine! Behold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one,
which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.” “Samaria
shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Standing on
the summit of the hill, and looking down on the mounds of stone poured into
the valley below, it would be difficult to find a more exact accomplishment
of prophecy than that before us. The ruins of the city subsequently built
upon the site are very striking, not only from their extent but from their
character and position. A double avenue of Corinthian columns may yet be
traced along the whole brow of the hill. The colonnade, according to Dr.
Porter, runs eastward in a straight line for about one thousand feet, and then
curves round to the left, following the sweep of the hill, extending altogether
about three thousand feet. On the north-eastern slope of the hill the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>falls back into a natural amphitheatre. The central part of this seems to have
been cut into steps forming tiers of seats, as though a theatre had been constructed
here. In front of these earthworks are the remains of another very
remarkable structure. Dr. Porter calculates that when the edifice was complete
there must have been one hundred and seventy columns, of which fifteen are still
standing. But we have no clue to the character of the building of which they
formed part.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Samaria northwards two routes of great interest and beauty lie
before us. The one leads westward through a line of valleys of extraordinary
fertility, where in spite of the sparse population and the depredations of the
Bedouins large crops of wheat and barley meet the eye. A few wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>villages stand amidst the luxuriant vegetation, the inhabitants of which, unprotected
by the government, have to repel, as best they can, the attacks of
the marauding nomads whose black tents may be seen on every hillside. These
sons of Ishmael, in whom the prophecy respecting their father is still exemplified,
“he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s
hand against him,”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> render travelling without an escort dangerous, but they
add greatly to the picturesqueness and interest of the scene. In the evening
their long lines of flocks and herds pouring into the encampment form a most
striking object in the landscape, and the elders may often be seen grouped
around a tent door recounting their exploits, or planning a foray upon some
hostile tribe, or listening to a story-teller reciting a tale from the ‘Arabian
Nights Entertainments.’ Upon a life of settled industry they look down with
contempt; “Mayst thou become a fellah” (a peasant) is one of the bitterest
curses which a Bedouin can pronounce upon his fellow-wanderer.</p>

<p>RUINS OF CÆSAREA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Soon we enter the northern portion of the plain of Sharon, through
the centre of which we passed on our way eastward from Jaffa. Leaving
behind us the mountains of Samaria and reaching the shores of the
Mediterranean, we find ourselves at Kaisariyeh, the ancient <span class='sc'>Cæsarea</span>.
This city was built by Herod the Great, with the design of connecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>himself more closely with the western world, and leaving behind him a
lasting monument of his power and magnificence. A vast mole was run
out into the sea to afford a secure harbour for shipping. A city was
reared which might vie in splendour with those of Italy, and surrounded with
fortifications which were deemed impregnable. A temple to Cæsar containing
statues not inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius, so Josephus asserts, rose on
an eminence within the walls. But the attempt thus to perpetuate his
memory was vain. All has gone down to utter ruin and decay. Even in
Palestine itself it would be hard to find a spot more utterly desolate than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>that of the proud capital of Herod. In the present day it is only remembered
by its connection with the obscure, hated, and despised sect whose founder he
sought to slay in His cradle at Bethlehem, and to whose death at Calvary his
son and successor was a consenting party. It was the scene of some of the
most memorable incidents in the Acts of the Apostles. Here Philip the deacon,
after the baptism of the Abyssinian eunuch, lived for many years as the pastor
of a prosperous church, and the centre of missionary activity throughout the
whole region. The first Gentile convert was here admitted into “the fellowship
of the saints,” in accordance with the vision vouchsafed to Peter at Joppa,
a day’s journey down the coast. It was at Cæsarea that Herod Agrippa
was smitten with the Divine judgment upon his impious pride and vainglory.
Hither Saul of Tarsus was brought on his way from Jerusalem;
and here Paul the Apostle, as a prisoner, “reasoned of temperance and
righteousness and judgment to come” with such persuasive force as to draw
from one of his judges the confession, “Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.”<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing our journey we soon leave the plain of Sharon, and find ourselves
amongst the lower spurs of Carmel, whose long ridge runs out as a
bluff promontory into the sea, a few miles to the northward. This, however,
will more fitly occupy a place in a subsequent section.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other route from Samaria to Galilee leads us through a district
richer in Scriptural associations than that just described. It runs almost due
north through a series of picturesque glens, or over romantic hills which need
only a moderate amount of labour to be turned into a succession of gardens.
At a little distance to the right is Talûza, the <span class='sc'>Tirzah</span> of the kings of Israel,
a royal residence, the beauty of which furnished Solomon with the comparison,
“Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah!”<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> A little farther on is Tûbâs,
or <span class='sc'>Thebez</span>, where Abimelech was slain by the hand of a woman, his ignominious
death furnishing a proverb for after years.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>About twelve miles north of Nablus, and just before descending into the
plain of Jezreel we pass the entrance to a broad, deep valley, or basin amongst
the hills on our right. Its name, <span class='sc'>Dothan</span>, recalls one of the most memorable
incidents in the lives of the patriarchs which formed one of the turning-points in
the history of the Church and of the world. Joseph, sent by his father to visit
his brethren in their favourite camping-ground at Shechem, found on his arrival
that they had passed northward to Dothan. Hither, therefore, he followed
them; and “when they saw him afar off they conspired against him to slay
him.” Having cast him into one of those deep pits with which the district yet
abounds—excavations formed by the inhabitants of the land for storing grain
or water, often shaped like an inverted funnel—they left him to perish.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Relenting in their murderous purpose, or prompted by the selfish hope of
gain, they subsequently drew him thence, and sold him to a company of
Midianites from Gilead, who were passing on their way down into Egypt.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Upon this slight incident the whole after-fortunes of the nation turned.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>JENIN, THE ANCIENT EN-GANNIM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here, as elsewhere throughout Palestine, a study of the topography
of the district gives unexpected confirmation or illustration to the narrative.
Dothan lies just off the main route by which the Bedouins, like the Ishmaelites
of old, travel on their way southward. Crossing by the upper ford of the
Jordan, near to Beisan, the ancient Bethshan, the caravans enter the main
road at Jenin, a short distance to the north, and pass the very spot indicated
by the inspired historian. I met several parties of Bedouins near Dothan,
“who came from Gilead with their camels,” conveying the produce of the
Hauran to exchange it in the bazaars of Jerusalem, Nablus, or Jaffa for the
manufactures of Europe, which is to the Syrian nomads of the present day
what Egypt was to their forefathers three thousand years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mound of ruins which rises from the valley of Dothan, marks the
site of the city. It was here that Elisha hid himself from the fury of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>king of Syria, when the monarch, infuriated at the repeated disclosure of his
plans by the prophet, resolved to put him to death, and for this purpose
“compassed the city both with horses and chariots.” But whilst the valley
was filled with the “great host,” “behold the mountain was full of horses and
chariots of fire round about Elisha,” so that he could confidently say, “Fear
not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a> As
we look at the valley girdled with hills on every side, and remember the
mighty host of defenders once revealed there to the eye of faith, we gratefully
call to mind the promise made to every believer, “The angel of the Lord
encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.”<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The town of <span class='sc'>Jenin</span>, which lies at the junction of several valleys and
roads, is a place of considerable importance. Its Scripture name, En-gannim,<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
(the fountain of the gardens) seems to be derived from a magnificent fountain
of water which rises in the hills just behind the town, and irrigating the rich
alluvial soil turns it into a garden. It has the reputation of being unhealthy;
but its picturesque minarets, surrounded by clumps of feathery palms, gardens
of cactus and prickly pear, and luxuriant orange groves, make it one of the
most beautiful towns in Palestine. Dr. Wilson, in his “Lands of the Bible,”
calls attention to the peculiar head-dress of the women of this district, and
thinks it illustrates the words of Solomon, “Thy cheeks are comely with
rows [of jewels], thy neck with chains [of gold].”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> Strings of gold coin hang
down from a sort of tiara upon the cheeks, like the tie of a helmet, and a
similar ornament is worn round the neck. A colony of Egyptians was settled
in this neighbourhood about half a century ago, and as it resembles the head-dress
of the fellaheen of Egypt it may have been derived from them, but it
is probably much older.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are now at the entrance of the great <span class='sc'>Plain of Esdraelon</span>, so
memorable in the military history of the Jews as the scene of some of their
greatest victories, and most disastrous defeats. It forms an irregular triangle,
stretching from the Mediterranean to the Jordan valley, bounded on the north
by the hills of Galilee, on the south by those of Samaria. Amongst the
former Tabor is the most conspicuous, both from its height and its peculiar
pyramidal form. The long ridge of Carmel stretches along the south-western
side. The mountains of Gilboa and Little Hermon rise out of the plain
itself at the eastern end.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>HEAD-DRESS OF EGYPTIAN FELLAHEEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Near the centre of the plain on a low flat-topped hill at the foot of the
western extremity of Gilboa, are a cluster of wretched mud hovels, now called
Zerin. They mark the site of <span class='sc'>Jezreel</span>, <i>the seed plot of God</i> as the name
means, and which it probably gained from the extraordinary fertility of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>soil.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Here stood the “ivory palace” of Ahab and the temple of Astarte
with its four hundred priests supported by Jezebel. On the eastern side overlooking
a steep rocky descent into the plain was the house of Jezebel, from
the window of which she was cast down at the command of Jehu. Killed
by the fall, she was left to be devoured by the troops of pariah dogs which to
this day prowl and snarl around every oriental city, and are its only scavengers.
The ruins of an ancient tower probably mark the spot where the watchman
stood looking out along the valley toward the Jordan, and saw Jehu driving
furiously towards the city. Though only the lower courses of the original
<i>Migdol</i> or watch-tower remain, yet a view may be gained for miles in the
direction from which Jehu was approaching, and every incident in the narrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>can be made out. A smooth open space outside the city is pointed
out as Naboth’s garden. The fountain by which he was slain, and where
the blood was washed from the chariot of Ahab is likewise shown, but the
biblical narrative seems to point to Samaria rather than to Jezreel as the
scene of the murder and the retribution.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

village. The crescent moon, the familiar symbol of the goddess of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Zidonians is sculptured upon them. It is possible, perhaps even probable,
that these very coffins once held the bones of the royal house which “taught

<div class='ic004'>
<p>MOUTH OF THE RIVER KISHON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The scene of the great battle between Sisera, the captain of Jabin king
of Hazor, and the Israelites under “Deborah the prophetess,” and “Barak,
the son of Abinoam,” was at the western end of the plain. Sisera was
encamped at the foot of Carmel near the Canaanitish city of Megiddo with
“his nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him
from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.” The Kishon is
a small stream which rises at the eastern end of Carmel and flows into the
Mediterranean. In summer it is nearly dry, but it rises with great rapidity and
when swollen by storms of rain becomes a rushing roaring torrent.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a> The little
army of Deborah consisted of the men of the northern tribes who had suffered
from the oppression of the king of Hazor. Those of the south and east were
indifferent to the sufferings of their brethren. “Reuben abode amongst the
sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks,” “Gilead abode beyond Jordan,”
“Dan remained in ships,” and “Asher continued on the sea-shore.” But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,
in the high places of the field.” With them was a contingent from Ephraim,
Benjamin, and Issachar. The small but heroic band of ten thousand men
encamped on Mount Tabor, a strong position, which commands a view
of the whole plain. At a signal from Deborah, Barak, with his compact
and resolute army, rushed down upon the foe and threw them into
confusion. Josephus informs us, that a sudden and violent storm of sleet and
hail aided the attack. “The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.”
The river swelling from a petty brook into a furious torrent completed the
rout. “The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river
Kishon.” Sisera alighting from his chariot fled away on foot, and as a solitary
fugitive met his death from a woman’s hand.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>No long time elapsed before a new and yet more terrible oppressor was
sent as a scourge to chastise “the children of Israel, who again did evil in the
sight of the Lord.” Every traveller in the Vale of Esdraelon has seen the
black tents of the Bedouins who have crossed the Jordan with their flocks and
herds for the rich pasturage which they here find. Until within the last few
years these wild maurauders were accustomed to lay waste the whole district,
carrying off the crops and the cattle of the peasantry without any check from
the corrupt and feeble government. It was from this quarter that the new
foe appeared. Vast hordes of these “children of the east ... came up with their
cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both
they and their camels were without number.” “They destroyed the increase
of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither
sheep, nor ox, nor ass.” A “mighty man of valour,” Gideon, the son of
Joash, was summoned by the angel of the Lord to undertake the task of
deliverance. He began by throwing down the altar to Baal. The invaders
at once gathered their forces to crush the rising spirit of resistance. They
pitched their tents all along the valley of Jezreel. Gideon and his men were
encamped on the mountains of Gilboa. Just where the mountains subside
into the plain a spring of water gushes out in such abundance as to form a
pool of considerable size, and then flows down to the Jordan. Gideon, who
had already reduced his numbers by dismissing to their homes all who were
“fearful and afraid,” was now ordered to reduce them still further by bringing
them down to the fountain to drink. The great majority went down upon
their hands and knees and drank from the stream. But three hundred hardy
veterans were satisfied to take a little water in the palms of their hands and
“lap it as a dog lappeth,” whilst they stood alert and erect upon their feet.
This was the little band by whom God was to work deliverance for Israel.
The smallness of the number would show that God “saveth not by many,
nor by few,” but by his own power. And the selected few—men vigorous,
temperate, and self-denying—were fitting instruments for Him to work with.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000'>Night had now closed over the scene. Gideon and his servant having crept
down amidst the sleeping hosts and overheard the narrative of a dream told
by one of the invaders to his companions, returned and prepared for the
attack. Dividing his men into three companies of a hundred each, they rush
upon the unsuspecting enemy. The trumpets peal out their shrill and
startling blast; the lamps flash forth in the midst of the tents; the war-cry
of Israel—“the sword of the Lord and of Gideon”—is heard rising loud and
high above the din; “and the Lord set every man’s sword against his fellow
throughout all the host: and the host fled” in wild confusion and disorder to
the fords of the Jordan, a few miles to the eastward. Here, as they attempted
to cross, they were attacked a second time, suffered a second defeat, and two
of their sheiks, Oreb and Zeeb—the Raven and the Wolf—captured and put
to death. Gideon and his three hundred heroes, “faint, yet pursuing,” continued
to press upon the rear of the flying foe. Coming up with them in
Karkor he attacked and defeated them yet a third time. Finding that their
kings Zebah and Zalmunna had “slain his brethren, the sons of his mother,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>he put them to the sword. This disastrous defeat finally broke up the
Bedouin confederacy. Never again whilst the Jewish commonwealth lasted
did “the children of the East” attempt an invasion.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The valley which had been the scene of these great victories was next
to witness a mournful defeat—that of Saul by the Philistines. The two
armies were encamped in nearly the same positions with those of Gideon and
the Midianites—the Israelites on Gilboa near the fountain of Jezreel, the
Philistines at Aphek, or Shunem, on the opposite side of the valley. Saul, in
his moody despair, “when he saw the host of the Philistines, was afraid, and
his heart greatly trembled. And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord
answered him not, neither by dream, nor by Urim, nor by the prophets.”
Like the great captain who long before had encamped on the same spot he
undertook a night journey, past the host of the Philistines, to the village of
Endor, which lay in the mountains a few miles in the rear of their camp.
His interview with the witch whom he went to consult but deepened the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>dark and gloomy cloud which hung around him. Next morning the battle
was joined, the Israelites were defeated, and “fell down slain in the mountains
of Gilboa.” The tragic end of Saul, and the pathetic lament of David
are too familiar to need further record here.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The inspired narrative contains allusions to other engagements of minor
importance as having been fought on this great battle-field: one of these scarcely
less mournful than the defeat and death of Saul is recorded in detail. It was
towards the close of the Jewish monarchy; that of Israel had already disappeared.
Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, on his way to attack the Assyrians,
was marching through this valley. Josiah, either to preserve the integrity of
his territory, or as being in alliance with the king of Assyria, met him at the
western end of the plain, near Megiddo. Necho warned him against
“meddling” in the conflict which concerned the Assyrians solely, and in
which he had no part. The result cannot be told more briefly and simply
than in the words of Scripture. “Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his
face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and
hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came
to fight in the valley of Megiddo. And the archers shot at king Josiah;
and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
His servants therefore
took him out of that
chariot, and put him in
the second chariot that he
had; and they brought
him to Jerusalem, and he
died, and was buried in
one of the sepulchres of
his fathers. And all Judah
and Jerusalem mourned
for Josiah. And Jeremiah
lamented for Josiah: and
all the singing men and
all the singing women
spake of Josiah in their
lamentations to this day;
and made them an ordinance
in Israel: and, behold,
they are written in
the Lamentations.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p>MONASTERY ON MOUNT CARMEL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One more event yet remains to be spoken of in connection with this
famous battle-field. It has been already said that the ridge of Carmel forms
one of the southern boundaries of the plain. Its north-western extremity runs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>out into the Mediterranean, and is crowned by the convent of Mar Elyas from
which the Carmelite monks take their name. At its south-eastern end, a
short distance below the summit, is a level plateau which looks down upon
Jezreel and commands an extensive view over the whole plain. Its modern
Arabic name is <span class='sc'>El Muhrakah</span> (<em>the place of burning</em>, or <em>of sacrifice</em>). A
perennial spring, which is said never to fail even in the severest droughts,
furnishes a copious supply of water. Near the foot of the hill is a mound
called the Tel Kasis (<i>the hill of the priests</i>). The river Kishon which flows
along the plain immediately below the plateau is called the Nahr el Mukatta
(<i>the river of slaughter</i>).<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a> All these names naturally connect themselves with
the sacrifice of Elijah, who on this plateau brought together the priests of
Baal, and when they had failed to win an answer from their idol gods, built
an altar, and drawing water from the fountain which after three years’ drought
still furnished an adequate supply, poured it over the sacrifice. The Lord
God of Israel answered by fire. The appeal was irresistible. The whole people
exclaimed with one voice—“The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God.”
Within sight of the idolatrous city, and beneath the eyes of the king, the apostate
priests were seized, dragged down to the mound and river, and slain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prophet now ascends to the top of the hill just above, from which a magnificent
view of the Mediterranean is obtained. Burying his face in his mantle,
in importunate prayer, he sends his servant to look out toward the sea. At
last a cloud is descried no larger than a man’s hand. For three years the
sky had been cloudless. Now the harbinger of rain is gratefully welcomed.
The prophet returns with the glad tidings to the monarch—“Prepare thy
chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.” These words have
caused some perplexity to commentators. Their meaning becomes perfectly
clear as read on the spot. The river Kishon, easily fordable at this point, and,
doubtless, perfectly dry after the protracted drought, would soon become a
rushing, furious torrent, as in the days of Sisera. Besides which the Plain
of Esdraelon consists of a rich alluvial soil which after a heavy rain-fall becomes
absolutely impassable for carriages, and is difficult even for horsemen or
pedestrians. If Ahab is to return to Jezreel he must do so at once. “And
it came to pass, in the meanwhile, that the heaven was black with clouds and
wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and
ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This famous battle-field, the scene of Israel’s most glorious victories and
most disastrous defeats, finds a place in the prophecies of the New, as well
as in the histories of the Old Testament. The name by which it is commonly
known, Esdraelon, is but a Grecised form of the Hebrew Jezreel. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>likewise called the valley of Megiddo from the town near which some of its
most desperate conflicts raged. Hence in the book of Revelation it is spoken
of as “the place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon” (<em>the hill</em>, or
<em>fortress of Megiddo</em>). This is not the place in which to discuss the precise
meaning of the prophecy, nor to enquire whether the inspired writer indicated
a particular locality as the scene of the final conflict, or used this historical
plain as typical of the battles yet to be fought between the powers of light
and darkness. One thing is clear, that the struggles of which the valley has
been the theatre only foreshadowed that more desperate conflict which awaits
us when “the spirits of devils, working miracles, go forth unto the kings of
the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that day
of God Almighty.”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Whatever the time, the place, the nature of that final
conflict may be, its terribleness cannot be doubted as we read the descriptions
given of it in the visions of Patmos. But the issue is certain. The wars of
ancient Israel were waged with doubtful fortune—victory and defeat alternated.
But in that “great day of God,” though the battle seem to hang long in
suspense, the victory is sure. The ”Captain of our Salvation” “goeth forth
conquering, and to conquer.” “He must reign till He hath put all enemies
under His feet.” Nor is the conflict altogether future. Even now it rages
around us, and we are summoned to take part in it. Neutrality and indifference
are impossible. “He that is not with us is against us.” May the
solemn words of reproof and warning spoken of those who stood aloof in the
Valley of Esdraelon sink into our hearts. “Curse ye Meroz! said the angel
of the Lord, Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof! Because they came
not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord, against the mighty.”
“How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow
him; but if Baal, then follow him.”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>IT is difficult to fix with precision the boundaries
of Galilee and Samaria. Originally
the Samaritan kingdom included the whole
territory of the ten northern tribes from
Dan to Bethel; but very soon it shrank
within much narrower limits. Galilee, at
first a small “circle,” as the name means,
around Kadesh Naphtali, on the frontiers
of Tyre,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a> had in the time of our Lord
become a province of great extent stretching
southward to the ridge of Carmel
and the mountains of Gilboa. The Plain
of Esdraelon, which under the kings of
Israel had been in the centre of Samaria,
was under the Romans its northern boundary, and belonged to Galilee.
Jezreel and the other historic sites in the neighbourhood being so closely
connected with the southern kingdoms have been spoken of in the preceding
chapter. We now proceed to the region lying to the north of the plain.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>FOUNTAIN OF MARY AT NAZARETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Galilee thus defined consists of a series of fertile hills and valleys, stretching
down from Hermon in the north to Tabor and Little Hermon on the
south. Its uplands are better wooded, its valleys and plains are richer, its
natural beauty greater than the rest of Palestine. Van de Velde truly
describes it as “a land rich in beauty and fertility. A thick wood of oaks
and other trees continued for a considerable way over the heights, again
through the valleys, but everywhere characterised by a luxuriance of verdure,
by which you can recognise at once the fertility of Naphtali’s inheritance.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>It was a region in which Asher should “dip his foot in oil;” Zebulun and
Issachar “rejoice in their going out, and in their tents” and “suck of the
abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand;” and Naphtali be
“satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord.”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the hills of Southern Galilee <span class='sc'>Tabor</span> is conspicuous, not so
much from its greater elevation—it only rises one thousand four hundred feet
from the plain—as from its peculiar form. It is a truncated cone, detached
from the surrounding heights, and forms a very striking object from whichever
side it is approached. Its general contour reminded me of the Wrekin
in Shropshire. Formerly it was richly wooded to the very summit; but the
timber has been cut down, and now only a few clumps or detached trees
spring from the verdant turf which clothes its sides. The view from the
summit is magnificent, commanding a panorama from the mountains of
Gilead to the Mediterranean, from Hermon, with its snowy summits, to Ebal
and Gerizim on the south. Well might the Psalmist exclaim,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The north and the south Thou hast created them:</div>
      <div class='line'>Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Its traditional claim to have been the scene of the transfiguration is now
universally abandoned. This must be sought for farther north, among the
gorges of the Hermon, near Banias, the ancient Cæsarea Philippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>In crossing the hills of Galilee from Esdraelon to Nazareth, we pass
three villages, each with a place in the inspired record. The first is Sôlem,
the ancient <span class='sc'>Shunem</span>. It lies at the foot of Little Hermon, about three miles
from the fountain of Jezreel. Luxuriant orange groves and corn-fields, fenced
with hedges of prickly pear, encompass a cluster of mud-walled, flat-topped
hovels. The inhabitants seemed a merry, good-humoured, contented race,
fearing nothing but a Bedouin raid, or a visit from the Turkish tax-gatherer.
Blocks of marble, with traces of sculpture upon them, probably brought from
the ruins of Jezreel, are worked into the mud-walls of the village, and the
largest house has a couple of willow-pattern plates, like those we noticed at
Bethel, with a dish to match, over the doorway. But there is nothing to
remind us that this is the scene of one of the most touching incidents which
the Bible records. It was here that a “great woman” of the village, “the
good, kind Shunammite,” made “a little chamber on the wall, and set there
a bed, and a stool, and a candlestick,” that the prophet might freely pass in
and out. Content to dwell “among her own people” she refused to “be
spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host.” And when a son was
granted to her old age her cup of happiness was full. Whilst scarcely a trace
of the ancient village exists, the surrounding scenery remains unchanged. It
was in these luxuriant corn-fields that the child, smitten by sunstroke, “said
to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>mother. And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
sat on her knees till noon, and then died.” We follow the bereaved mother,
choking down her sobs, and saying “It is well,” as she rides hurriedly across
the plain to the prophet’s haunt on Carmel, and sympathize with her joy as
she receives back her son.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>TABOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A little farther to the north stands another village, to which a more
tragic interest attaches—<span class='sc'>Endor</span>, the goal of Saul’s journey the night before
his death. The Israelites, as we have seen, were encamped near the fountain
of Jezreel on Mount Gilboa, the Philistines at Shunem, about midway between
Endor and the camp of Saul. The king at the peril of his life gropes his
way past the outposts of the enemy to reach the woman who is to reveal to
him the secrets of the future. The village retains its ancient name unchanged.
And one of the numerous caves still, as formerly, used as dwellings
may have afforded a fitting abode for the miserable and wicked woman whose
heart relented towards the doomed and despairing king.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<div id='i185'  class='figcenter id010'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>NAIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A ride of about fifty minutes brings us from Endor to <span class='sc'>Nain</span>. It is a
small, poor village, standing on the
shoulder of a hill, looking down on one
arm of the Valley of Esdraelon. Not
very far from Nazareth, and visible
across the valley from the hill above
the town, it is by no means improbable
that our Lord may have known the
young man and his widowed mother.
If, as many suppose, He was Himself
“the only son of his mother, and
she was a widow,” a special reason
for the miracle is at once discovered in
His deep human sympathy with a case
so like His own. A steep path leads
up the hill side to a group of rock-hewn
graves, marking the site of the ancient burial-place of the town. It was
on this very path that our Lord saw the weeping mother and “had compassion,
and said unto her, Weep not.” Turning to the bier, His word of
pity became a word of power, and “He said, Young man, I say unto thee,
Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
him unto his mother.”<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But a spot of yet deeper and more absorbing interest than any we have
visited since we left Jerusalem draws us onward, and we hasten over the
intervening space till we reach <span class='sc'>Nazareth</span>. Up among the hills to the
north of the plain is a valley about a mile in length, and perhaps a quarter
of a mile in breadth. Several smaller valleys run out from it, and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>junction of two or three of these it expands into a basin over which the hills
rise to a height of four hundred or five hundred feet. “It seems,” says
Dr. Richardson, rather fancifully, “as if fifteen mountains met to form an
enclosure for this delightful spot: they rise round it like the edge of a shell
to guard it from intrusion. It is a rich and beautiful field in the midst of
barren mountains.” The bottom of the basin is bright with gardens and
orchards, divided by hedges of prickly pear twelve or fourteen feet high.
The town stands on the western side of the valley and rises a little way up
the slope of the hill. It has a brighter, cleaner, and more prosperous look
than any town we have seen since leaving Nablus. The population was
estimated by Robinson at four thousand. It has increased since then, and
is now probably about five thousand. Of these a large proportion are Christian
in profession, though it is to be feared that their conduct is little in keeping
with the pure and high morality of the gospel. Two large monasteries, one
of the Greek, the other of the Latin rite, contain a large number of monks.
A recently established Protestant mission seems to be efficient and successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants of Nazareth, like those of Bethlehem, are deservedly
famed for their personal beauty. I was fortunate enough to be present at
the wedding festivities of a wealthy landed proprietor in the town. The bride,
unfortunately, was absolutely ugly; but I was greatly struck by the fine
features of many of the women and the noble bearing of the men. Dr. Porter
says truly, “If we go out and sit for an hour of an evening by the little
fountain, we shall see many a face which Raphael might have chosen as a
study when about to paint his <i>Madonna della Seggiola</i>, and many a figure
that Phidias might have selected as a model for Venus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Monkish legends and traditions of course are rife throughout the town
and neighbourhood. Always offensive, they are doubly so here, both from
their absurdity and from the contrast they afford to the silence of Scripture
respecting the youth and early manhood of our Lord. We are shown the
workshop of Joseph, the house of Mary, and the place from which it was
carried away to find its final resting-place at Loretto! A cave is pointed
out as the place of the Annunciation. A large slab of stone is declared to
be the table at which our Lord and His disciples ate before and after the
Resurrection. The traditional Mount of Precipitation is two miles away from
the town in defiance of the express statement of Scripture that it was on
“the brow of the hill on which the city was built.”<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>NAZARETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fountain of Mary at the eastern end of the town is a place of deep
interest. At all hours of the day groups of girls may be seen who have
come hither to draw water. It is the common centre around which the
whole life of the village gathers. The pilgrim stops to quench his thirst, the
shepherd to water his flocks, the girls, with merry song and laughter, fill their
pitchers, linger for a gossip with their friends, then poising the vessel upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>their shoulders, walk away with light and graceful step. The fountain has
been here from time immemorial, and seems always to have been the main, if
not the only source of water-supply for the inhabitants. It was to the fountain,
which now bears her name, that Mary came, day by day, amongst the village
maidens, to fill her pitcher and return to her home. The <i>Protevangelion</i>, one
of the earliest of the Apocryphal gospels, says that it was here that she
received the angelic salutation which marked her out as the mother of the
Lord. The narrative however seems to indicate what the probabilities of the
case imply, that the event happened in the seclusion of her own dwelling.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>CLIFF BEHIND THE MARONITE CONVENT AT NAZARETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A hasty and general survey of the site of Nazareth produces the impression
that it contains no cliff down which Jesus could have been “cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>headlong.” The town lying along the lower slope of the hill, no steep declivity
is visible. But a more careful examination corrects the error and confirms
the narrative of the evangelist. I found two or three precipitous walls of
rock of thirty or forty feet in depth. One of them had a considerable accumulation
of debris at the bottom which if cleared away would probably give
twenty feet more. Dean Stanley’s remarks are well worth quoting. “‘They
rose’ it is said of the infuriated inhabitants of the city, ‘and cast Him out of
the city, and brought Him to a brow of the mountain on which the
city was built, so as to cast Him down the cliff.’<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a> Most readers probably
imagine a town built on the summit of a mountain, from which summit the
intended precipitation was to take place. This, as I have said, is not the
situation of Nazareth, yet its position is in strict accordance with the narrative.
It is built upon, that is on the side of ‘a mountain,’ but the brow is not
beneath but over the town, and such a cliff as is here implied is to be found
in the abrupt face of the limestone rock, about thirty or forty feet high,
overhanging the Maronite convent at the south-west extremity of the town.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To gain a true idea of the scenes amidst which the first thirty years of
our Lord’s earthly life were passed we must climb the hills which rise above
the town. There is very little in the Nazareth of to-day to recall that of
eighteen hundred years ago. Not a single building is now standing which
was standing then. It is even doubtful whether the site remains unaltered:
and we know that important changes have passed over the scenery of the
neighbourhood. The soil has lain fallow and unproductive for centuries. A
silent, unpeopled solitude stretches for miles around us. But in our Lord’s
days Galilee was like a garden in its luxuriant fertility. The hills, now so
bare and barren, were terraced and cultivated to their very summits. A
numerous and thriving population occupied the soil. “The little hills rejoiced
on every side; the pastures were clothed with flocks; the valleys also
were covered over with corn.”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a> But amidst all these changes the great
natural landmarks remain the same. As we stand on the ridge which rises
just above the town, we know that we tread on the very spots where Jesus
of Nazareth often walked, and that we look on the landscape which was beneath
His eye. The hills, the valleys, the sea, the plains make up a scene of
surpassing beauty, the main features of which are unaltered by the lapse of
centuries. Below us lies the little town in the peaceful seclusion of its quiet
valley—far from the busy crowd, aside from the thronged highways. On the
west the sun is sinking down into the sea, leaving a broad line of light across
the Mediterranean. Hermon, on the north, with its crown of snow, glows in
the fading light. “The excellency of Carmel and Sharon” stretch away to
the south. Eastward the eye ranges over the hills of Galilee, the valley of
the Jordan, and the rich plains of Gilead beyond. The view though somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>less extensive than that from Tabor is even more beautiful. The hours
of a Sabbath afternoon and evening spent in meditation and prayer on the
thymy turf of this glorious upland have left behind them memories which no
lapse of time can efface or weaken.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>CHURCH OF THE ANNUNCIATION, NAZARETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The numerous flocks of sheep and goats which were being led in to be
folded for the night formed a striking object in the landscape, and recalled to
mind a question which has perplexed many eastern travellers. Our Lord,
speaking of His coming to judgment, says, “And before Him shall be
gathered all nations; and He shall separate them from one another as a
shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a> But the sheep and the goats
are invariably brought in together. I had failed to find any instance in which
they were divided. This, of all others, was the place to seek an explanation.
It was given me by a shepherd who was leading his flock past the
spot where I stood. The division is made not in the evening when the flocks
are folded, but in the morning as they are taken out to pasture. The goats
travelling much more quickly than the sheep and thriving upon a much
scantier vegetation, are driven up to the mountain tops where they pick
their food from amongst the rocks and stones. The sheep are kept upon
the lower slopes, where the grass is more abundant and the pasturage richer.
It is thus not to the night of death when “like sheep they are laid in the
grave,”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a> but the resurrection morning to which the illustration points and
when the final separation shall be made. In this case, as in so many others
the seeming discrepancy arises from our imperfect acquaintance with the
facts. A more complete knowledge not only removes the apparent difficulty,
but brings out a deeper meaning in the sayings of Him whose “words are
spirit and are life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot leave Nazareth without reflecting on the silence of Scripture
respecting our Lord’s residence here. Of the thirty-three years of His earthly
life twenty-eight were spent in this secluded valley; yet the history of those
years is an almost total blank. A journey to Jerusalem is the only incident
recorded. “The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:
and the grace of God was upon Him.... He was subject unto His parents....
He increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
This is all we know—no more. Imagination, working upon Apocryphal
legends and obscure hints, has endeavoured to fill in the vague outline with
biographical details. But the attempt is unwarranted, even if it be not
irreverent. It is impossible for us to lift the veil which hides these years of
mysterious growth and silent preparation. When “the day of His showing
unto Israel” had come, He emerged from His obscurity; and we shall trace
His footsteps on the shores of the neighbouring lake, the world’s great Teacher,
revealing God to man, and man to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at <span class='sc'>Cana of Galilee</span>, the home of Nathanael,<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a> that our Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>worked His first miracle, “and manifested forth His glory.”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a> There are two
villages near Nazareth, still bearing a similar name, each of which has been
regarded as the scene of the manifestation. Kefr Kenna, a small village
about an hour and a half to the north-west, and Kana-el-Jelil at double the
distance. The former is the traditional site. The claims of the latter are
supported by the deservedly high authority of Robinson, and its name is
absolutely identical with that of the Biblical narrative. It is perhaps impossible
to decide in which of the two it was that</p>

<p class='c011'>With the exception of a fountain, apparently of the Roman period, said to

either of them to connect itself with the miracle. In the wedding festivities
at Nazareth, of which I have already spoken, the bride was brought from
near Kefr Kenna. The innumerable guests who thronged the house for a
week, served to illustrate and to account for the inadequacy of the supplies
provided for a similar festivity in the time of our Lord.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>ONE of the most interesting passages in the
writings of Josephus is that in which he
narrates the history of his campaign
against the Romans on and around the
Lake of Gennesareth. Having spoken
of the clear, cold waters of the lake,
the innumerable ships and boats which
floated upon it, and the prosperous towns
and villages which lined its banks, he
proceeds to describe the fertile plain
from which it takes its name. “The
country also that lies over against this
lake hath the same name of Gennesareth;
its nature is wonderful as well
as its beauty; its soil is so fruitful that
all sorts of trees can grow upon it, and
the inhabitants accordingly plant all sorts of trees there; for the temper of the
air is so well mixed, that it agrees very well with those several sorts, particularly
walnuts, which require the coldest air, flourish there in vast plenty;
there are palm-trees also, which grow best in hot air; fig-trees also and olives
grow near them, which yet require an air that is more temperate. One may call
this place the ambition of nature, where it forces those plants that are naturally
enemies to one another to agree together; it is a happy contention of the
seasons, as if every one of them laid claim to this country; for it not only
nourishes different sorts of autumnal fruit beyond men’s expectation, but preserves
them a great while; it supplies men with the principal fruits, with grapes
and figs continually during ten months of the year, and the rest of the fruits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>as they become ripe together, through the whole year; for besides the good
temperature of the air, it is also watered from a most fertile fountain. The
people of the country call it Capharnaum.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p>TOWN AND LAKE OF TIBERIAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The traveller who visits the Lake with this passage in his mind, and
expects to find its descriptions realised is doomed to disappointment. The
population has disappeared. To the stir of busy life a mournful silence has
succeeded. A single filthy ruinous town—Tiberias—half-a-dozen wretched
villages, and the black tents of the Bedouins, are the only human habitations
on the banks. Where Herod, Josephus, and Titus could, without difficulty,
collect fleets of from three hundred to five hundred vessels, I only found three
small fishing-boats, and these so dilapidated that their owners dared not launch
them except in a perfect calm. The soil is fertile and productive as ever,
but labour is wanting to break up the fallow ground, to cast in the seed, or
to reap the harvest.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>THE NORTH SHORE OF THE LAKE, NEAR TELL HUM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But there is a sense in which this mournful silence and solitude are felt
to be not inappropriate. There is nothing to distract our thoughts from that
Divine Presence which here abode in human form. One great memory
lingers undisturbed amongst these hills and valleys. The bustle of modern
life and the squalid misery and degradation of the eastern peasantry would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>equally clash with the sacred, tender associations of the spot where “most
of His mighty works were done,” most of His “gracious words” were
spoken. The stage is empty, and there is nothing to prevent our peopling
it with hallowed memories of Him who spake as “never man spake,” who
was Himself “the way, the truth, and the life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The contrast between the silence of Scripture as to our Lord’s life at
Nazareth and the ample details which it gives of His life here is very striking.
To mention them all would be to quote the larger part of the first three
gospels and some of the most striking incidents of the fourth. He “dwelt
in Capernaum” which was “His own city.”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> On the shores of the lake He
called Peter, Andrew, James, John, and Matthew to be His disciples.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a> In
the villages and towns around it “most of His mighty works were done.”<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
In a mountain overlooking it, from a boat upon it, and in a town on its
banks, He taught the people in His most memorable discourses.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a> Over its
waters He often sailed, on them He walked, hushed its storm to a calm,
and rescued His faint-hearted disciple who was sinking beneath them.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> In
a desert place on its shore he twice fed the assembled multitudes.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a> But
space is wanting to enumerate all the mighty deeds and gracious words of
which this hallowed spot was the scene, and which culminated in that
affecting interview when He manifested Himself to His disciples after His
resurrection and restored Peter to the place from which he had fallen in the
apostolic band.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the Old Testament the lake is known as the sea of Chinneroth, or
Chinnereth, from a city which stood on its north-western shore.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a> Gennesareth
is probably a Grecised form of the earlier name, though its etymology (<i>a
garden of riches</i>) suggests a very suitable derivation. By this name or by
that of the Sea of Galilee it is commonly known in the New Testament.
John, writing after the city of Tiberias had risen to importance as the capital
of Galilee, speaks of it as “the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias,”<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
a fact which is not without importance as fixing the date of his gospel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road from Nazareth to Tiberias leads over the low ridge which
bounds the valley on the north-west, across a broken table-land, and through
the village of Kenna, already spoken of as the traditional site of Cana in
Galilee. Sefurieh, the ancient Sepphoris, is passed. It played an important
part in the heroic but unsuccessful resistance of the Jews to the Romans
under Titus, and hither the Sanhedrim retired after the fall of Jerusalem.
The battle-field of Hattin is likewise distinctly seen, where the last great
battle was fought between the Crusaders and Saladin, issuing in the total
destruction of the Christian army and the establishment of the Moslem power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in the East. The hills which enclose the lake soon come into view, but the
lake itself is not seen till we reach the summit of the steep descent which
leads down to Tiberias, a thousand feet below us. The clear, blue, placid
waters lie in a deeply depressed basin nearly seven hundred feet below
the level of the sea. Some geologists have supposed it to be the crater of
an extinct volcano. More careful investigation, however, proves that this
is a mistake. It is but a part of that long line of depression which, starting
from the sea level near the Lake Huleh, sinks down along the whole Ghor
or valley of the Jordan, till at the Dead Sea it has reached the unparalleled
depth of thirteen hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lake is about thirteen miles in length by about six or seven in
breadth at the widest part. The mountains on the eastern side rise to a
height of two thousand feet, but they are flat and monotonous, destitute
alike of colour and of foliage. The scenery has neither the bold outline of
the Swiss lakes, nor the rich verdant loveliness of our own. The tamer parts
of Windermere, stripped of their glorious mantle of forests, the grey hill-sides
bleak and bare, would give a not unapt illustration of the shores of the Sea of
Galilee.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not read that our Lord ever entered Tiberias. The reason
is doubtless to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city,
though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together
the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia.
There was a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium,
a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the
Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who “was not sent
but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel” might well hold himself
aloof from such scenes as these.</p>

<p class='c000'>Modern Tiberias is a village of about two thousand inhabitants. A large
proportion of these are Jews, who regard it as one of their holy places and
have here a rabbinical school. It is filthy and squalid beyond even the
average of eastern towns. From the swarms of vermin with which it is infested
the Arabs have a proverb that “the king of the fleas lives at Tiberias.”
Wilson says that on spending a night here he was literally covered with
them and plucked them from his coat by handfuls. In common with other
places in the valley of the Jordan it suffers severely from earthquakes. In
the great shock of January, 1837, the Turkish walls which surround the
town were shattered, and in many places laid prostrate. As under the present
government nothing is ever repaired, the fortifications remain in the dilapidated
condition in which they were left nearly forty years ago.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>THE TOWN OF TIBERIAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Northward from Tiberias the hills on the western side slope gently down
nearly to the edge of the lake. The strip of shore is of extraordinary fertility.
Though now uninhabited and uncultivated, it is easy to believe that the
glowing descriptions of Josephus were in no degree exaggerated. In about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>an hour after leaving Tiberias we find the hills gradually recede, leaving a
broad open plain—that of Gennesareth. The only sign of human habitation
is a cluster of mud hovels near the water’s edge. There are a few remains
of other buildings, one of which seems to have been a watch-tower (<i>Migdol</i>).
A palm-tree rises from the centre of the village and a few thorn bushes
cluster round it. The modern name Mejdel reminds us that this was
<span class='sc'>Magdala</span>, the place where our Lord came ashore after feeding the multitude
on the opposite bank,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and the home of Mary Magdalene.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a> Into the disputed
questions as to her history we do not enter here. We know how great a
debt of gratitude she owed to her Lord, who had delivered her from demoniacal
possession in its most aggravated form; and how fondly and devotedly
she attached herself to His service, ministering to Him of her substance,
waiting at His cross, present at His entombment, watching at His sepulchre,
and first to welcome her risen Lord when He had burst “the bonds of death”
and “led captivity captive.” As we stand amongst these crumbling ruins
and squalid hovels we cannot but reflect upon the fact that through her the
name of this spot has passed into all the languages of Christendom, is commemorated
in the noblest ecclesiastical edifice of modern France, and holds
a conspicuous place in our military history as that of the almost impregnable
stronghold of a bloodthirsty Abyssinian tyrant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every step we took in this district, hallowed by so many sacred associations,
seemed to furnish a fresh commentary on the discourses of our Lord.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Every detail in the parable of the sower passed under our view—the hard
pathway running through unenclosed fields upon which the seed fell without
finding entrance, the soil choked with thorns through which the tender blades
were struggling, the thin, shallow coating of earth resting upon the rock
beneath, and the luxuriant growth of the rich deep loam bringing its return
of a hundredfold to the sower.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c010'><sup>[260]</sup></a> The edge of the lake is fringed with
thickets of oleander in full bloom. The turf carpeted with an incomparable
profusion of wild flowers, the variety and splendour of which surpassed all
that I had seen elsewhere, covered the earth with a mantle of beauty with
which “Solomon in all his glory” could not vie.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Here and there is a fisherman
who has cast off his “fisher’s coat” and stands “naked” in the water
“casting his nets,” or drawing them ashore, or examining his haul, choosing
the good, rejecting the worthless.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='ce-caption'>SOUTHERN END OF THE SEA OF GALILEE.</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000'>Many travellers have spoken of the sudden and violent storms to
which the lake is liable. This is common to all lakes surrounded by
mountains. But the danger is greatly increased here by the depression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of the surface below the sea level. Gusts of wind rush down from the
mountains into the rarefied air below, and raise storms of extraordinary
suddenness and fury. One of these I experienced which illustrated many
of the details of New Testament history. I had taken a boat on a
bright, cloudless morning, to explore the eastern shores and the point where
the Jordan enters the lake. There was not a ripple on the water, not a
perceptible current in the air. Almost without warning the wind rose, the
waves, crested with foam, began to break over the sides of the boat. I was
sitting on a cushion or “pillow” on the flat, raised stern “in the hinder
part of the ship” and watched the crew “toiling in rowing.” But all their
efforts were vain. They were unable to make any way for “the wind was
contrary.” At length one of them jumped overboard, and partly swimming,
partly wading, towed the vessel ashore close to the site of Capernaum.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
Walking thence to our camp at Khan Minyeh we passed the probable site
of Bethsaida (<i>the house of fish</i>). Here we found the fishermen washing,
drying, and mending their nets.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c010'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>HILLS OVER GENNESARETH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At the end of a glen which ran westward from our camp is the mountain
which tradition asserts with some probability to be that of the Beatitudes,
and high above it, visible from every point for miles around, is the city of
Safed—“a city which is set on a hill and cannot be hid.”<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c010'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The hills do not rise direct from the lake but stand at a little distance
from it, leaving a strip of shore, of varying breadth, at their feet. But there is
one striking exception to this rule. On the eastern bank, near to Khersa, the
ancient Gergesa, is a steep, almost precipitous descent coming down into the
lake itself with no intervening space between. It was here, in the very
place which the narrative indicates, that the “herd of swine ran violently
down a steep place into the sea.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c010'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Into the disputed questions as to the topography of the northern and
north-western shore we have not space to enter. A volume might be written
summing up the various arguments adduced as to the sites of Capernaum,
Chorazin, and the Bethsaidas, without arriving at a conclusive and final result.
The balance of probability seems to me to incline in favour of the identification
of the fountain of Tabigah with that of Capharnaum described by
Josephus. Capernaum as the chief town of the district would stretch for
some distance along the shore. The ruins of Tell Hum are not so far distant
from the fountain but that they might have formed part of the city or its
suburbs. And nowhere else have remains been found the character and
extent of which would indicate the site of a commercial centre and great
military station which we know Capernaum to have been. The similarity of
name is likewise an important point. <i>Tell</i> is a mound of ruins; <i>Kefr</i>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><i>Capher</i>, is a village. Tell Hum would thus be the ruined mound of the
ancient Capher Nahum, or village of Nahum. Without presuming to dogmatize
on the subject, the balance of probabilities seems to favour the view
that it was here that our Lord took up His abode on leaving Nazareth, so
that it was called “His own country.”</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>RUINS OF ET TABIGAH (BETHSAIDA?).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the ruins of Tell Hum, the most interesting and important are
those of a synagogue apparently of the Roman period. It was built of white
marble, with finely carved Corinthian columns, and sculptures of the seven-branched
candlestick, the paschal lamb, and the pot of manna. If Tell Hum
be indeed the site of Capernaum this ruined synagogue becomes invested
with an interest absolutely unique, for it is the only edifice now remaining
which we can, with any probability, associate with the personal history of
our Lord. It was here that “He taught on the sabbath days. And they
were astonished at His doctrine: for His word was with power.” Here,
too, He cast out the unclean spirit who acknowledged Him as “the Holy
One of God,” and, amid the murmurs of the Pharisees, healed the man
with a withered hand.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c010'><sup>[267]</sup></a> Whilst the ruins are unmistakably those of a Jewish
synagogue, the Corinthian columns seem to indicate a Roman element and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>feeling at work in the construction. It is thus, at least, a plausible conjecture
that this is the very edifice referred to by “the elders of the
Jews” when pleading on behalf of the centurion they said, “he loveth our
nation, and he hath built us the (τὴν) synagogue.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a>” Captain Wilson, cautious
and careful almost to excess as he is, says, “If Tell Hum be Capernaum,
this is without doubt the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one
of the most sacred places on earth.” It was in this building that our Lord
gave the well-known discourse in John vi.; and it was not without a certain
strange feeling, that on turning over a large block, we found the pot of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, “I am that bread
of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead.”<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, of Ephraim and Manasseh. The records
of the tribe of Dan are especially meagre. It contributed only one great
name to Jewish history—that of Samson—and he belonged to the original
settlement of the Danites in the south-east on the borders of the plain of
Sharon. The statement in Judges xviii. 30, 31, seems to imply that even at
this early period the children of Dan had separated themselves from the
commonwealth of Israel and established a political and religious organization
of their own which lasted down to “the captivity of the land.” This may
account for the remarkable omission of all mention of the tribe not only in
the genealogical tables of 1 Chronicles ii.-xii., but also in the enumeration of
“all the tribes of the children of Israel” in Revelation vii. 4-8.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contrast between what the country once was and what it is now,
which has so often been referred to already, is most striking in the district
upon which we are now entering. Dr. Porter says: “On reaching the brow
of the long ascent, where the lake lies far below us, with the green valleys
radiating from it, and the rich plateaux spreading out from the top of its high
banks, we cannot refrain from sitting down to gaze upon that vast panorama.
A mournful and solitary silence reigns over it. Nature has lavished on it
some of her choicest gifts; but man has deserted it. In the whole valley
of the Jordan, from the lake Hûleh to the sea of Galilee, there is not a single
settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes,
from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax—a region of great
fertility, thirty miles long by seven or eight wide—there are only some <em>three
inhabited villages</em>! The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are
numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now
well-nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of
Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force—‘I will make your cities waste,
and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation. And I will bring the land into
desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after
you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall
the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your
enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.’”<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p>BRIDGE OF JACOB’S DAUGHTERS.<br /><i>From a Sketch by T. Jenner, Esq.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Leaving the hilly country which lies on the northern side of the Lake
of Gennesareth, we enter a broad open plain through which the Jordan
meanders on leaving Lake Hûleh, the <span class='sc'>Waters of Merom</span> of Scripture.
About two miles south of the lake
is an ancient bridge called Jisr
Benat Yakûb (<i>the Bridge of Jacob’s
Daughters</i>). The exact meaning of
the name is unknown. It seems to
have originated in an erroneous tradition
that the patriarch crossed the river
at this spot when returning from his
sojourn in Mesopotamia, and met his
brother Esau here. But no reason
is assigned for his daughters being
introduced in connection with it. It
was formerly a post of considerable
importance, being the point at which
the main road from Egypt and Jerusalem
turned westward to Damascus. Century after century invading armies
or caravans of peaceful traders have passed to and fro along this route; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>none of them have left results so deep and lasting as when, eighteen hundred
years ago, Saul of Tarsus, “breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, ... journeyed to Damascus,”<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a> little thinking, as
he crossed this bridge, that he should return to preach the faith he now
sought to destroy.</p>

<p class='re-caption'><i>By Permission of Mr. Macgregor.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000'>Of Lake Hûleh little was known until it was explored by Mr. Macgregor
in his canoe voyage on the Jordan. It is a triangular sheet of water, about
four and a half miles in length by three and a half in its greatest breadth,
surrounded by an impenetrable morass covered with tall canes and papyrus
reeds, through which, as the Arabs declare, it is impossible even for a wild
boar to make its way. It could not be surveyed from the shore, and until
Mr. Macgregor’s adventurous expedition no boat had ever floated on its
waters. The additions which he has made to our knowledge of the hydrography
of the district are of the highest value; and his vigorous narrative
of the difficulties he surmounted, and the perils he escaped amongst the wild
Bedouins of the district is familiar to all our readers.</p>

<p>LAKE HÛLEH, OR THE WATERS OF MEROM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was in this hot, seething, pestilential, but fertile plain that Joshua, after
the subjugation of central and southern Palestine, fought his third and last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>great battle with the hosts of Canaan. Jabin, king of Hazor, rallied round
him all the chiefs who had not yet yielded.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a> They came from “the plains
south of Chinneroth,” the Jordan valley south of the sea of Galilee, the
Jebusite from the fortress of Benjamin, the Hittite and the Amorite from the
far south, to “the Hivite under Hermon,” in the north. “And they went
out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that
is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. And
when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at
the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.” It was doubtless the multitude
of their horses and chariots, a force not possessed by Israel, which induced
them to select this long plain as their battle-field. Suddenly Joshua and
his men fell upon them from the heights above, and the Lord delivered them
into the hand of Israel, who smote them and chased them far to the west,
across the hills and valleys of Galilee, where their horses and chariots could
only encumber them, right across the land to Zidon, utterly destroying
them in the long pursuit, houghing their horses, and burning their chariots.
Northward and eastward, too, Joshua chased the Hivites even to the valley
of Mizpeh, the plain of Cœle-Syria, which extends to the entering in of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Hamath. So utter was the rout, so complete the victory, that no cities
attempted further resistance, as they had done in the south. Hazor, the
capital, and probably the stronghold of king Jabin, was the only place which
Joshua burned with fire when he turned back from the pursuit. The whole
land was now secured to Israel to the base of Lebanon, and the four northern
tribes were settled in their allotted possessions.</p>

<p>HERMON FROM THE NORTHERN SHORE OF LAKE HÛLEH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Soon after passing the northern end of the lake the snowy summit of
Hermon, which has been previously visible at intervals for some days,
comes full into view, and forms a fine feature in the landscape. A cool,
refreshing breeze flows down from its glittering heights, and is doubly
welcome in the sultry plain over which we are toiling. The contrast
between the near and the distant landscape is very striking. The plain of
Hûleh might be a portion of tropical Africa. Droves of black, hairless
buffaloes wallow in the swamps. The Gawarineh Arabs, almost black and
quite naked, live in reed huts like many negro tribes, and twist their hair
into a tuft like the inhabitants of the Gold Coast. The intense heat produces
a semi-tropical vegetation. But we have only to turn our eyes to the
northern horizon to see a long stretch of snow as bright, and clear, and cold
as that of Switzerland.</p>

<p>HERMON FROM NEAR TELL-EL-KADI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We cross a fine old Roman bridge which spans the picturesque gorge of
the Hasbany, and soon reach a remarkable mound or <i>tell</i>, from the foot of
which gushes out a stream of water so broad and deep that we may almost
call it a river. This is one of <span class='sc'>the Sources of the Jordan</span>. The mound
above it is called the Tell-el-Kadi (<i>the Mound of the Judge</i>), a rare instance
of a name being retained not in sound but in meaning. “Dan” in Hebrew,
like “Kadi” in Arabic, means judge; and here stood the <span class='sc'>City of Dan</span>. The
history of the conquest is graphically told in the book of Judges.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c010'><sup>[273]</sup></a> The tribes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>finding their territory on the borders of Sharon too strait for them, sent spies
northward, who reported that “the land was very good, a place where there
is no want of anything that is in the earth.” The Zidonian colonists, far
from their mother city, were leading lives of luxury and licentiousness; “they
dwelt carelessly, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there
was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in anything.”
The warlike Danites burst upon them, stormed their city of Laish, conquered
the whole territory, and transferred the head-quarters of the tribe to their
new home. The exquisite fertility and beauty of the country justifies the
report of the spies. But, like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem
to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk
down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged.
The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered
a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble
deed wrought by the degenerate tribe, and, as we have seen, their name
disappears from the roll both of the natural and of the spiritual Israel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other main source of the Jordan rises at the town of Banias, about
four miles from Tell-el-Kadi. At the foot of a limestone cliff is a large cave,
formerly dedicated to the god Pan, from which the modern Arabic name of
the town is derived. Several niches and dedicatory tablets, with Greek inscriptions,
cut in the face of the rock yet remain. Masses of fallen rock and
débris obstruct the entrance and bury the actual fountain-head. From beneath
these a stream rushes forth in wonderful strength and volume. As at Tell-el-Kadi,
it is a river at its source. Only a few yards from the spot at which
it emerges from its rocky birth-place, I plunged in, and found myself out of
my depth, in a current so strong that it was difficult to swim against it. The
torrent rushes on over a rocky bed fringed with oleanders, past the ruins
of the ancient city, and soon is joined by its sister-stream from Tell-el-Kadi.
The Hasbany then falls into it a few miles above Lake Hûleh. The united
waters from this point take the familiar name of the Jordan, to pursue their
impetuous course till they are lost amid the arid shores of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation of Banias is one of unusual beauty. Robinson speaks of
it as “unique; combining in an unusual degree the elements of grandeur and
beauty. It nestles in its recess at the southern base of the mighty Hermon,
which towers in majesty to an elevation of seven thousand or eight thousand
feet above; whilst the abundant waters of the glorious fountain spread over
the terrace luxuriant fertility, and the graceful interchange of copse, lawn, and
waving fields.” All travellers are struck by the park-like character of the
surrounding district. Trees of great size and beauty stand in clumps upon
the green turf. Innumerable rivulets and waterfalls give vivacity to the scene,
and justify the epithet of Dean Stanley, who calls it “a Syrian Tivoli.”
Massive remains of Roman fortifications give to the modern village an air of
venerable dignity. The ruined castle of Es-Subeibeh, on the peak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Hermon just above the town, is incomparably fine. Its situation, its extent,
and the magnificent views which it commands over the fertile plains of the
Upper Jordan on the one side, and the gorges of Hermon on the other, are
perhaps unsurpassed in the world.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p>THE SOURCE OF THE JORDAN AT BANIAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Banias does not appear in Scripture under its present name. Robinson
suggests that it is the “Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount
Hermon,”<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a> up to which the conquests of Joshua extended in this direction.
For us its chief interest is found in the fact that it was the <span class='sc'>Cæsarea Philippi</span>
which formed the northern limit of our Lord’s ministry, and the neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of which was the scene of His transfiguration.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a> The monkish legend which
placed it at Tabor is now universally abandoned. The secluded valleys and
gorges which run from the very suburbs of the town amongst the spurs of
Hermon afford a fitting theatre for this wonderful manifestation. It was in
sight of the mighty mass of the venerable mountain that He proclaimed
Himself to be the rock upon which His church should be built. Surrounded by
the temples of Syrian, Greek, and Roman deities, with which the region was
profaned, He declared that the gates of hell should not prevail against it. It
was amongst these solemn solitudes that the voice was heard from heaven
saying, “This is my beloved Son: hear Him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was deep significance in the time and place at which this manifestation
of Divine glory was made. It was, as we have seen, the northern
limit of His earthly ministry. It was, too, at the close of His last missionary
journey. Henceforward His face was “steadfastly set to go up to Jerusalem,”
for “the time was come that He should be received up.”<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a> He now commenced
that pilgrimage southward of which the cross was the foreseen goal. Step
by step along the road by which we have travelled He pressed onward, each
step bringing Him nearer to “the decease which He should accomplish at
Jerusalem;” of which “Moses and Elias spake with him” as they “appeared
in glory.”<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The thoughts and feelings excited by a visit to Palestine, find apt expression
in the words of two authors, widely separated from each other in time
and in character. The first is a crusader, Sir John Mandeville, deeply imbued
with the credulity and superstition of the Middle Ages. Writing more than
five centuries ago, he says in the Prologue to his ‘Voiage et Travaille’:
“Forasmuch as the land beyond the sea, that is to say, the Holy Land,
which men call the land of promise or of behest, passing all other lands, is
the most worthy land, most excellent, and lady and sovereign of all other
lands, and is blessed and hallowed with the precious body and blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ; in which land it pleased him to take flesh and blood of
the Virgin Mary, to environ that Holy Land with his blessed feet; and
there he would, of his blessedness, shadow him in the said blessed and
glorious Virgin Mary, and become man and work many miracles, and preach
and teach the faith and the law of Christian men unto his children; and there
it pleased him to suffer many reprovings and scorns for us; and he that was
king of heaven, of air, of earth, of sea, and of all things that are contained
in them, would only be called king of that land, when he said ‘Rex sum
Judeorum,’ that is to say, I am king of the Jews; and that land he chose
before all other lands, as the best and most worthy land, and the most
virtuous land of all the world.... See, now, how dearly he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>bought man, that he made after his own image, and how dearly he redeemed
us for the great love that he had to us, and we never deserved it of him;
for more precious goods or greater ransom might he not put for us, than his
blessed body, his precious blood, and his holy life, which he enthralled for us;
and he offered all for us, that never did sin. Oh! dear God! what love had
he to us his subjects, when he that never trespassed, would for trespassers
suffer death! Right well ought we to love and worship, to dread and serve
such a Lord, and to worship and praise such a Holy Land, that brought forth
such fruit, through which every man is saved, unless it be his own fault.
Well may that land be called delectable and a fruitful land, that was made
moist with the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ; which is the same
land that our Lord promised us in heritage.”<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The second is a writer living in our time and expressing the critical
and sceptical tendency of modern thought—M. Renan. He says: The
scientific mission, having for its object the exploration of ancient Phœnicia,
which I directed in 1860 and 1861, led me to reside on the frontiers of
Galilee, and to travel there frequently. I have traversed in all directions
the country of the Gospels, I have visited Jerusalem, Hebron and Samaria;
scarcely any important locality of the history of Jesus has escaped me.
All this history, which at a distance seems to float in the clouds of an unreal
world, thus took a form, a solidity which astonished me. The striking
agreement of the texts with the places, the marvellous harmony of the
gospel ideal with the country which served it as a framework, were like a
revelation to me. I had before my eyes a fifth gospel, torn, but still legible,
and henceforward, through the recitals of Matthew and Mark, in place of an
abstract being, whose existence might have been doubted, I saw living and
moving, an admirable human figure.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c010'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The superstitious crusader and the cold sceptical critic thus agree in
attesting the influence exerted upon them by “those holy fields.” The
devotion of the one is kindled as he visits the earthly abode of the incarnate
deity. The intellect of the other is convinced as he traces the footsteps
of Jesus of Nazareth. To many of the readers of this volume it may not
be granted to gaze upon the spots hallowed by memories of patriarchs and
prophets, and apostles, and of our Lord himself. But all may reach “the
better country, that is, a heavenly,” of which the earthly Canaan was but a
type; all may share the vision and the blessedness of “the New Jerusalem,”
“the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”</p>

    <div>Drawn with Pen and Pencil. Profusely Illustrated. Imperial 8vo. 8<i>s.</i> cloth elegant.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“The more we turn over the pages of this book the more we
like it. Italy is the theme of a great deal of fine writing and
fine painting, but the plain descriptions and accurate drawings
here really tell us more about it than a library of inspired
poems, and a gallery of ideal painting.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>“An extremely beautiful and interesting book.”—<cite>Daily News.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“The result of keen observation and considerable reading,
it is a very charming volume. It contains, in an unusual
degree, the information of a handbook, and the attractiveness
of a drawing-room album.”—<cite>British Quarterly Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“Not less interesting than was either of the corresponding
volumes.”—<cite>Standard.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c018'>Spanish Pictures.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>Drawn with Pen and Pencil. With Illustrations by <span class='sc'>Gustave Doré</span> and other eminent</div>
    <div>Artists. Imperial 8vo. 8<i>s.</i> cloth elegant.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Another book about Spain, and a capital one: more distinctly
calculated to catch the attention of persons on the look-out for
present-books, and yet at the same time of solid merit.”—<cite>Literary
Churchman.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“The pen is that of the author of ‘Swiss Pictures’; one of the
pencils is Gustave Doré’s, and the others are not unworthy to be
associated with his. It therefore follows that the letterpress
is pleasant reading, and that many of the sketches are of the
highest excellence.”—<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“A most exquisite book. It abounds with illustrations (some
by Gustave Doré) of the most striking scenes, buildings, and
social manners of the Peninsula, and realises in a series of brilliant
and attractive pictures the romance, poetry, beauty, and inexpressible
charms of the land of ‘Don Quixote.’”—<cite>Daily News.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c018'>Swiss Pictures.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>Drawn with Pen and Pencil. With numerous Illustrations by <span class='sc'>Whymper</span> and others.</div>
    <div>Imperial 8vo. 8<i>s.</i> cloth elegant.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“In this third edition there are so many additions and improvements,
that this very beautiful volume is still more attractive
and beautiful than before.”—<cite>Standard.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“Its numerous wood-engravings are all of great excellence,
charming as pictures, and admirable as examples of Art. The
book contains an immense amount of information, conveyed by
the pen and the pencil; for the author, too, has done his work
thoroughly well.”—<cite>Art Journal.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“In every way an attractive volume, one of the best works of
the kind; the present edition contains upwards of thirty
new illustrations, and has been carefully revised. It is an
admirable gift-book, and very cheap.”—<cite>Record.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“It is enough commendation to say that the pencil is for the
most part Mr. Whymper’s, for he is surpassed by no living artist
in the vigour and truth with which he expresses mountain forms....
The ‘pen’ is confessedly subordinate to the ‘pencil’;
but it plays an admirable second, not wasting its ink on mere
reiterated expressions of admiration or laboured descriptions,
which never succeed in really describing anything, but selecting
choice morsels of historical association, picturesque anecdotes of
mountain climbing, and classical passages from the great writers
in prose and verse, who have illustrated the Alps by their
genius.”—<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

soil is very fertile. The reply of several peasants when questioned was, “If we had people to till the ground, and a

<p class='c000'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. We learn from Gen. l. 25, 26, Exod. xiii. 19, and Joshua xxiv. 32, that Joseph gave strict commands to his
descendants that his body should be carried back into Canaan, that it was embalmed and placed in a coffin, that in
the confusion of the flight out of Egypt his dying injunction was not forgotten, and that the bones of Joseph, which the
children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the
sons of Hamor (Gen. xxxiii. 19). The Mohammedan tradition is that the mummy was afterwards removed to Machpelah.
The ambiguous statement of Stephen (Acts vi. 16) seems to imply that though buried at Shechem he was yet laid in the
sepulchre with Abraham. A passage in Josephus (<cite>Ant.</cite> ii. 8, 2) may bear the same meaning; and the spot pointed
out as that of Joseph’s tomb is in perfect accordance with this view, it being detached from that of the others at one
corner of the mosque, as though the wall had been broken through at a later period than the previous interments, and
after the main entrance into the cave had been finally closed up.</p>

the Jebusites. Throughout the Moslem world it is now known as <i>El-Kuds</i>, the holy city, or as <i>El Kuds esh Shereef</i>, the
holy, noble city. Herodotus is thought to have referred to it as Cadytis. In this case, as in so many others throughout
Palestine, the modern Arabic name is simply a return to a more ancient one.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
